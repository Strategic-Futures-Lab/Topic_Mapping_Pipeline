A,The EU and the ECHR: collective and non-discrimination labour rights at a crossroad?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-eu-and-the-echr-collective-and-non-discrimination-labour-righ,"This article considers the future development of the constitutionalisation of labour rights, in particular non-discrimination rights and collective labour rights, within the European Union’s (EU) legal order following the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and in light of the EU’s impending accession to the Council of Europe. Accession throws a spotlight on the relationship between the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and the Court of Justice of the EU (CoJ). The two courts’ respective interpretations of certain labour rights contain elements of overlap and, in some respects, conflict which will presumably have to be reconciled under the new legal order within which the courts will find themselves. It is argued that the constitutionalisation of labour rights would offer some important protections that should be fundamentally guaranteed and thus available to all workers but which, due to transnational changes resulting from globalisation, are under threat. Furthermore, as the case law analysis demonstrates, the traditional hierarchy of rights by which civil and political rights were prioritised over their economic and social counterparts, has given way to an EU legal order whereby the economic imperative remains paramount with social provisions, in the context of labour rights, subjugated and subject to further divisions.",A & B & C & D,536
B,Aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate salts as green and efficient coupling partners for the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction: from optimisation to mole scale,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/aryldiazonium-tetrafluoroborate-salts-as-green-and-efficient-coup,"The use of aryldiazonium tetrafluoroborate salts as coupling partners in the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction was investigated from a process chemistry perspective including safety evaluation, solvent and catalyst screening and multi-variate factor optimization. Optimised conditions were applied to a range of substrates to evaluate the scope and limitations of the reaction and one example was carried out on mole-scale to demonstrate the practicality and scalability of the process",E & F & G,879
C,Search for gravitational radiation from intermediate mass black hole binaries in data from the second LIGO-Virgo joint science run,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/search-for-gravitational-radiation-from-intermediate-mass-black-h,"This paper reports on an unmodeled, all-sky search for gravitational waves from merging intermediate mass black hole binaries (IMBHB). The search was performed on data from the second joint science run of the LIGO and Virgo detectors (July 2009-October 2010) and was sensitive to IMBHBs with a range up to similar to 200 Mpc, averaged over the possible sky positions and inclinations of the binaries with respect to the line of sight. No significant candidate was found. Upper limits on the coalescence-rate density of nonspinning IMBHBs with total masses between 100 and 450 M-circle dot and mass ratios between 0.25 and 1 were placed by combining this analysis with an analogous search performed on data from the first LIGO-Virgo joint science run (November 2005-October 2007). The most stringent limit was set for systems consisting of two 88 M-circle dot black holes and is equal to 0.12 Mpc(-3) Myr(-1) at the 90% confidence level. This paper also presents the first estimate, for the case of an unmodeled analysis, of the impact on the search range of IMBHB spin configurations: the visible volume for IMBHBs with nonspinning components is roughly doubled for a population of IMBHBs with spins aligned with the binary's orbital angular momentum and uniformly distributed in the dimensionless spin parameter up to 0.8, whereas an analogous population with antialigned spins decreases the visible volume by similar to 20%.",H,431
D,Student teachers perceptions of critical incidents in their professional learning,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/student-teachers-perceptions-of-critical-incidents-in-their-profe,"Our aim is to explore student teachers’ perceptions of what constitutes critical learning incidents in their very early careers. The investigation will seek to identify patterns across the student body which will provide an overview of key learning incidents. We wish to investigate how much importance they give to different aspects of their school experience. 	
The study addresses three key questions:
1.	What do PGDE student teachers define as critical incidents in their school-based early professional development?
2.	How can these critical incidents be categorised?
3.	To what extent do the patterns evident in student responses match current course design?
This investigation will adopt a mainly qualitative, interpretative analysis of critical incident data, seeking to shed light on what student teachers see as critical to their own placement learning.  
Participants have submitted demographic information along with anonymised critical incident notes.  The individual critical incident ‘cases’ will be analysed using modified analytic induction, a process of iterative inductive and deductive coding through which descriptive hypotheses can be developed in order to identify patterns and perceptions.  
Data analysis is ongoing at the time of writing.  Cross-case themes will identify patterns across the participant group as a whole. These themes, or patterns, will be further interrogated using the demographic data provided to allow for identification of potential gender, age or other differences.  Alongside this, to preserve the richness of the data, individual vignettes will illustrate either common or divergent themes. 
Main findings and conclusions will be reported at the conference.",I & J,451
E,Effect of ultrasound on mass transfer during electrodeposition for electrodes separated by a narrow gap,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effect-of-ultrasound-on-mass-transfer-during-electrodeposition-fo,"This work reports an investigation on mass transfer by ultrasound agitation during electrodeposition on electrodes separated by a narrow inter-electrode gap. Polarisation experiments were performed to identify the mass transfer limiting current. The limiting current density was used to calculate mass transfer boundary layer thicknesses which were used to develop mass transfer correlations. Experiments were carried out using a cell with parallel copper discs which were positioned at gaps of 1, 0.5 and 0.15cm. The distance between the ultrasonic probe and electrodes was varied between 3 and 1.5cm. The polarisation data showed clear limiting current plateaux when the distance between the electrodes was larger, however significant distortions were observed when the gap was 0.15cm. It was found that lower ultrasound powers of 9-18W/cm2 provided more effective agitation at narrower electrode gaps than powers exceeding 18W/cm2. Sherwood correlations showed that in this system, developing turbulence occurs for larger inter-electrode spacing, whereas for narrow electrode gaps fully turbulent correlations were obtained. A 2-D current distribution model showed that potential distortions that were observed in the polarisation data were caused by the close placement of the metallic US probe to the two parallel electrodes.",K & L & M,437
B,Translating research into practice: a cross-sectional study using the Early Development Instrument to assess early years interventions in local level public health practice,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/translating-research-into-practice-a-cross-sectional-study-using-,"Evidence that early years interventions can reduce inequalities has led to Scottish Government policy recommending that local areas implement initiatives to improve early child development. How best to measure the effects of these interventions is, however, unclear. We conducted a pilot study of the first UK use of the teacher-administered Early Development Instrument (EDI), an internationally validated measure of global child development now used at school entry in all children in Australia and most of Canada.
The study, conducted in the primary school setting in 2011–12, was cross-sectional in design and used qualitative and quantitative methods. During phase 1 the EDI was adapted for the Scottish context. 14 teachers assessed 154 pupils, using the instrument. Focus groups and semi-structured questionnaires were used to gather feedback from teacher participants on the instrument and the process. Phase 2 collected and analysed data from 1090 pupil participants, comprising 98% of eligible school-entrants in East Lothian local authority, assessed by 68 teachers. The 104-item EDI questionnaire has five domains of child development: physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive, and communication and general knowledge. Data were analysed with SPSS (version 17.0). The psychometric properties of the EDI were assessed with Cronbach's α. Mean scores in the domains were linked to levels of deprivation and results were mapped using Geographic Information System. Phase 3 monitored subsequent dissemination and use of EDI results. The study was approved by the School of Psychological Sciences and Health Ethics Committee of the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK; the Education Authority of the relevant school district; and the Chief Scientist Office of the Scottish Government. In line with EDI data collection in other countries, opt-out consent was used for parents of pupils. All teachers provided written, informed consent.
Children in the most deprived quintile were 2·8 times more likely than the most affluent to be developmentally vulnerable in one or more domains; however, substantial developmental vulnerability was found across all five quintiles, not only in the most deprived. The EDI was found to be user friendly and acceptable to teachers, demonstrating high levels of internal reliability. Dissemination of results created a forum for multidisciplinary discussion and raised awareness about the importance of early child development, domains of development, and how inequalities can be tackled, leading to new initiatives based on EDI data.
The EDI is a robust instrument able to highlight developmental differences in children between socioeconomic groups and small-scale geographical areas. Its simplicity and usability lend themselves easily to community-wide implementation.",M & A,666
D,Multimessenger search for sources of gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos: initial results for LIGO-Virgo and IceCube,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/multimessenger-search-for-sources-of-gravitational-waves-and-high,"We report the results of a multimessenger search for coincident signals from the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories and the partially completed IceCube high-energy neutrino detector, including periods of joint operation between 2007–2010. These include parts of the 2005–2007 run and the 2009–2010 run for LIGO-Virgo, and IceCube’s observation periods with 22, 59 and 79 strings. We find no significant coincident events, and use the search results to derive upper limits on the rate of joint sources for a range of source emission parameters. For the optimistic assumption of gravitational-wave emission energy of 10−2  M⊙c2 at ∼150  Hz with ∼60  ms duration, and high-energy neutrino emission of 1051  erg comparable to the isotropic gamma-ray energy of gamma-ray bursts, we limit the source rate below 1.6×10−2  Mpc−3 yr−1. We also examine how combining information from gravitational waves and neutrinos will aid discovery in the advanced gravitational-wave detector era.",B & C,434
A,Transient 2D-IR spectroscopy of inorganic excited states,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/transient-2d-ir-spectroscopy-of-inorganic-excited-states,"Time-resolved infrared spectroscopy has been proven to be a powerful tool for investigating the structure, dynamics and reactivity of electronically-excited states of inorganic molecules. As applications drive the production of ever more complex molecules however, experimental tools that can deliver more detailed spectroscopic information, or separate multiple contributions to complex signals will become increasingly valuable. In this Perspective, the extension of ultrafast infrared spectroscopy of inorganic excited states to a second frequency dimension using transient 2D-IR spectroscopy (T-2D-IR) methods is discussed. Following a brief discussion of the experimental methodologies, examples will be given of applications of T-2D-IR ranging from studies of the spectroscopy, structure and dynamics of photochemical intermediates to new tools for correlating vibrational modes in ground and excited electronic states and the investigation of excited state solvation dynamics. Future directions for these experiments are also discussed.",B & C & D,239
E,Target shape identification for nanosatellites using monocular point cloud techniques,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/target-shape-identification-for-nanosatellites-using-monocular-po,"Many mission scenarios for nanosatellites and CubeSat hardware have already been created that will require autonomous target tracking and rendezvous maneuvers in close proximity to other orbiting objects. While many existing hardware and software designs require the use of rangefinders or laser-based sensors to identify and track nearby objects, the size and power limitations of a CubeSat make a simple monocular system greatly preferable, so long as reliable identification can still be carried out. This presentation details the development and testing of an embedded algorithm for visually identifying the shape of a target and tracking its movement over time, which can include rotation about any axis. A known three-dimensional geometric model is required for use as a reference when identifying a target. First, feature descriptors implemented in the OpenCV framework are used to create a sparse point cloud of features from a nearby object. Using structure-from-motion (SfM) methods, feature points obtained over successive images can be triangulated in three dimensions to obtain a pose estimate. Statistical shape recognition is then used to identify the object based on features from available three-dimensional models. While more feature points make the identification more accurate, more computing power is required, and within the limitations of an embedded system, the balance of speed and accuracy is evaluated. The algorithm is designed to be efficient enough for feasible operation using embedded hardware useable on a CubeSat, and can be used with appropriate hardware for real-time operation. An overview of the algorithm and vision system design is given, and some initial test results for a simulated orbital rendezvous scenario are provided for some indication of the performance of these methods. Applications of interest for this type of algorithm include external monitoring of other spacecraft, robotic capture and docking, and space debris removal.",E & F,194
C,The regulation of healthcare in the European Union: member states' discretion or a widening of EU law? Femarbel and Ottica New Line,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-regulation-of-healthcare-in-the-european-union-member-states-,"In the context of healthcare, the ECJ's jurisprudence has recently been clarified and codified in Directive 2011/24/EU on patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (""Patients' Mobility Directive""). Two judgments recently issued by the ECJ make interesting reading in this regard. While the facts of Femarbel and Ottica do not bear much resemblance to each other, the judgments illustrate that the definition of what falls under the umbrella of healthcare services is not always obvious. Moreover, the cases provide a timely example of attempts by commercial interest groups to use EU law to open up domestic healthcare markets to private, commercial service providers. As such, the judgments have the potential to provide more clarity on the scope of the Directive 2006/123 on services in the internal market (""the Services Directive"") and Member States' discretion in regulating healthcare provision in their territory. Finally, the judgments provide further examples of the ECJ's willingness to adjudicate in cases concerning wholly internal situations.",H & J,194
C,UTP is not a biased agonist at human P2Y11 receptors,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/utp-is-not-a-biased-agonist-at-human-p2ysub11sub-receptors,"Biased agonism describes a multi-state model of G protein-coupled receptor activation in which each ligand induces a unique structural conformation of the receptor, such that the receptor couples differentially to G proteins and other intracellular proteins. P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that are activated by endogenous nucleotides, such as ATP and UTP. A previous report suggested that UTP may be a biased agonist at the human P2Y11 receptor, as it increased cytosolic [Ca2+], but did not induce accumulation of inositol phosphates, whereas ATP did both. The mechanism of action of UTP was unclear, so the aim of this study was to characterise the interaction of UTP with the P2Y11 receptor in greater detail. Intracellular Ca2+ was monitored in 1321N1 cells stably expressing human P2Y11 receptors using the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent indicator, fluo-4. ATP evoked a rapid, concentration-dependent rise in intracellular Ca2+, but surprisingly, even high concentrations of UTP were ineffective. In contrast, UTP was slightly, but significantly more potent than ATP in evoking a rise in intracellular Ca2+ in 1321N1 cells stably expressing the human P2Y2 receptor, with no difference in the maximum response. Thus the lack of response to UTP at hP2Y11 receptors was not due to a problem with the UTP solution. Furthermore, coapplying a high concentration of UTP with ATP did not inhibit the response to ATP. Thus contrary to a previous report, we find no evidence for an agonist action of UTP at the human P2Y11 receptor, nor does UTP act as an antagonist.",L & K & C,285
D,Transition metal-mediated synthesis of oxazoles,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/transition-metal-mediated-synthesis-of-oxazoles,"Among the synthetic methods for the formation of the oxazole ring, transition metal-mediated protocols are the most attractive in terms of selectivity, efficiency and mildness of reaction conditions. In this review we discuss methods for the preparation of oxazoles using transition metal complexes highlighting the key bonds being formed. This reveals critical gaps in the existing literature for the construction of this biologically significant ring system highlighting exciting opportunities for further research.",A & D,594
E,Inside cover: The synthesis of highly active iridium(I) complexes and their application in catalytic hydrogen isotope exchange (Adv. Synth. Catal. 17/2014),https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/inside-cover-the-synthesis-of-highly-active-iridiumi-complexes-an,"The inside cover picture, by Kerr and co-workers depicts a series of robust, yet highly active Ir(I) complexes bearing specifically encumbered N-heterocyclic carbene and phosphine ligands. These complexes are extremely effective in hydrogen isotope exchange processes (with D or T), with low catalyst loadings, good levels of selectivity, and broad directing group applicability. The labelling of several complex drug molecules further highlights the catalysts’ utility. Mechanistic insight into the operation of these catalysts has also been provided by a combination of NMR and theoretical DFT studies.",F & L & B,828
A,On the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of block triangular preconditioned block matrices,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/on-the-eigenvalues-and-eigenvectors-of-block-triangular-precondit,Block lower triangular matrices and block upper triangular matrices are popular preconditioners for $2\times 2$ block matrices. In this note we show that a block lower triangular preconditioner gives the same spectrum as a block upper triangular preconditioner and that the eigenvectors of the two preconditioned matrices are related.,E,979
B,Interdependency modeling of supply chain risks incorporating game theoretic risks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/interdependency-modeling-of-supply-chain-risks-incorporating-game,"Most of the current risk quantification techniques being applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management consider risk factors to be independent. This research considers risks as interdependent triggers, events and consequences. We propose a risk quantification framework based on Bayesian belief network modeling that is an effective method to capture the mentioned interaction between various risk factors. The conflicting incentives among stakeholders in a supply chain can jeopardize the success of a project and therefore, quantification of this category of risks named as 'Game theoretic risks' needs special consideration. We have assessed game theoretic risks in the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. The game theoretic analysis captures uncertainty of the Tier-1 suppliers about the cost functions of each other and demonstrates that any uncertainty of information in a supply chain can adversely affect the intended outcome. Finally, we have designed a fair sharing partnership featuring continuous time domain and present value of money concept that aligns the conflicting incentives.",A,961
A,Validity and reliability of an alternative method for measuring power output during six second all out cycling,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/validity-and-reliability-of-an-alternative-method-for-measuring-p,"In a laboratory setting where both a mechanically-braked cycling ergometer and a motion analysis (MA) system are available, flywheel angular displacement can be estimated by using MA. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the validity and reliability of a MA method for measuring maximal power output (Pmax) in comparison with a force transducer (FT) method. Eight males and eight females undertook three identical sessions, separated by 4 to 6 days; the first being a familiarization session. Individuals performed three 6-second sprints against 50% of the maximal resistance to complete two pedal revolutions with a 3-minute rest between trials. Power was determined independently using both MA and FT analyses. Validity: MA recorded significantly higher Pmax than FT (P < .05). Bland-Altman plots showed that there was a systematic bias in the difference between the measures of the two systems. This difference increased as power increased. Repeatability: Intraclass correlation coefficients were on average 0.90 ± 0.05 in males and 0.85 ± 0.08 in females. Measuring Pmax by MA, therefore, is as appropriate for use in exercise physiology research as Pmax measured by FT, provided that a bias between these measurements methods is allowed for.",G & H,709
A,A multidirectional Physarum solver for the automated design of space trajectories,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-multidirectional-physarum-solver-for-the-automated-design-of-sp,This paper proposes a bio-inspired algorithm to automatically generate optimal multi-gravity assist trajectories.The multi-gravity assist problem has some analogies with the better known Traveling Salesman Problem and can be addressed with similar strategies. An algorithm drawing inspiration from the Physarum slime mould is proposed to grow and explore a tree of decisions that corresponds to the possible sequences of transfers from one planet to another. Some examples show that the proposed bio-inspired algorithm can produce solutions that are better than the ones generated by humans or with Hidden Genes Genetic Algorithms.,I & C & M,629
B,Gelation mechanism of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels investigated by dynamic light scattering,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/gelation-mechanism-of-resorcinol-formaldehyde-gels-investigated-b,"Xerogels and porous materials for specific applications such as catalyst supports, CO2 capture, pollutant adsorption, and selective membrane design require fine control of pore structure, which in turn requires improved understanding of the chemistry and physics of growth, aggregation, and gelation processes governing nanostructure formation in these materials. We used time-resolved dynamic light scattering to study the formation of resorcinol-formaldehyde gels through a sol-gel process in the presence of Group I metal carbonates. We showed that an underlying nanoscale phase transition (independent of carbonate concentration or metal type) controls the size of primary clusters during the preaggregation phase; while the amount of carbonate determines the number concentration of clusters and, hence, the size to which clusters grow before filling space to form the gel. This novel physical insight, based on a close relationship between cluster size at the onset of gelation and average pore size in the final xerogel results in a well-defined master curve, directly linking final gel properties to process conditions, facilitating the rational design of porous gels with properties specifically tuned for particular applications. Interestingly, although results for lithium, sodium, and potassium carbonate fall on the same master curve, cesium carbonate gels have significantly larger average pore size and cluster size at gelation, providing an extended range of tunable pore size for further adsorption applications.",L,577
B,Biomass-derived oxymethylene ethers as diesel additives: a thermodynamic analysis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/biomass-derived-oxymethylene-ethers-as-diesel-additives-a-thermod,"Conversion of biomass for production of liquid fuels can help in reducing the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions which are predominantly generated by combustion of fossil fuels. Adding oxymethylene ethers (OMEs) in conventional diesel fuel has the potential to reduce soot formation during the combustion in a diesel engine. OMEs are downstream products of syngas, which can be generated by the gasification of biomass. In this research, a thermodynamic analysis has been conducted through development of data intensive process models of all the unit operations involved in production of OMEs from biomass. Based on the developed model, the key process parameters affecting the OMEs production including equivalence ratio, H2/CO ratio, and extra water flow rate were identified. This was followed by development of an optimal process design for high OMEs production. It was found that for a fluidized bed gasifier with heat capacity of 28 MW, the conditions for highest OMEs production are at an air amount of 317 tonne/day, at H2/CO ratio of 2.1, and without extra water injection. At this level, the total OMEs production is 55 tonne/day (13 tonne/day OME3 and 9 tonne/day OME4). This model would further be used in a techno-economic assessment study of the whole biomass conversion chain to determine the most attractive pathways.",B & H,832

A,Dynamic and static characteristics of drug dissolution in supercritical CO2 by infrared spectroscopy: measurements of acetaminophen solubility in a wide range of state parameters,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dynamic-and-static-characteristics-of-drug-dissolution-in-supercr,"In this work we use infrared spectroscopy to investigate solubility properties of a bioactive substance in supercritical CO2 (scCO2). By using acetaminophen as a model compound, we show that the method can provide high sensitivity that makes it possible to study solubility at small concentrations, up to 10-6 mol·L-1. This method also allows one to investigate the kinetics of the dissolution process in supercritical solvent. Our measurements at two different points of the (p, T) plane ((40 MPa, 373 K) and (40 MPa, 473 K)) have shown significant difference in the kinetic mechanisms of acetaminophen dissolution at these two states: at higher temperature the dissolution process in scCO2 has two steps: (i) ""fast"" step when the acetaminophen concentration in scCO2 quickly reaches (70 to 80) % of the saturation level and (ii) a subsequent ""slow"" step where the acetaminophen concentration slowly increases up to the saturation level. However, at lower temperature, the dissolution process has only one, ""slow"" step.",A & B & C & D,731
B,A survey on communication technologies and requirements for internet of electric vehicles,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-survey-on-communication-technologies-and-requirements-for-inter,"Electric vehicles (EVs) are becoming a more attractive transportation option, as they offer great cost savings, decrease foreign oil dependency, and reduce carbon emissions. However, varying temporal and spatial demand patterns of EVs threatens power grid operations and its physical components. Thus, the ability of the power grid to handle the potential extra load has become a major factor in the mainstream success. In order for this integration to occur seamlessly, the power grid and the consumers need to be coordinated in harmony. In this paper, we address the critical challenges introduced by the penetration of EVs, systematically categorize the proposed frameworks for demand management, and the role of information and communication technologies in the solution process. We provide a comprehensive survey on the communication requirements, the standards and the candidate technologies towards the Internet of electric vehicles (IoEV). This survey summarizes the current state of research efforts in electric vehicle demand management and aims to shed light on the continued studies.",E & F & G,969
C,Study on order analysis for condition monitoring wind turbine gearbox,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/study-on-order-analysis-for-condition-monitoring-wind-turbine-gea,"A complex 3-stage gearbox design, in which one planetary
gear set at first stage and two sets of parallel gears at second
and third stage, is conventionally applied on the large wind
turbine configuration with Doubly Fed Induction Generator.
In this variable-speed wind turbine, it is hard to directly apply
conventional frequency analysis on condition monitoring of
the gearbox planetary stage. Proper signal processing and
analysis become crucial here for interpreting the conditions of
gears and bearings. In this paper, order analysis is studied for
condition monitoring the planetary stage of wind turbine
gearbox. The approach takes advantage of angular resampling
to achieve cyclo-stationary vibration signals and
lessen the effects due to speed changes. One key element in
the scheme is taking angular information to enable resampling
the time-domain signals into angular-domain signals.
A vibration signal model for gearbox planetary stage is firstly
described, and the scheme is then tested on simulated signals
to achieve fine frequency resolution. Time synchronous
averaging is applied as a pre-processing technique to enhance
the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) in order spectrum",H,642
D,Identifying PV module mismatch faults by a thermography-based temperature distribution analysis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/identifying-pv-module-mismatch-faults-by-a-thermography-based-tem,"Photovoltaic solar power generation is proven to be effective and sustainable but is currently hampered by relatively high costs and low conversion efficiency. This paper addresses both issues by presenting a low-cost and efficient temperature distribution analysis for identifying PV module mismatch faults by thermography. Mismatch faults reduce the power output and cause potential damage to PV cells. This paper firstly defines three fault categories in terms of fault levels, which lead to different terminal characteristics of the PV modules. The investigation of three faults is also conducted analytically and experimentally and maintenance suggestions are also provided for different fault types. The proposed methodology is developed to combine the electrical and thermal characteristics of PV cells subjected to different fault mechanisms through simulation and experimental tests. Furthermore, the fault diagnosis method can be incorporated into the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes to shift the operating point of the PV string. The developed technology has improved over the existing ones in locating the faulty cell by a thermal camera, providing a remedial measure and maximizing the power output under faulty conditions.",I & J,966

B,Application of a Hough search for continuous gravitational waves on data from the fifth LIGO science run,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/application-of-a-hough-search-for-continuous-gravitational-waves-,"We report on an all-sky search for periodic gravitational waves in the frequency range 50-1000 Hz with the first derivative of frequency in the range -8.9 Chi 10(-10) Hz s(-1) to zero in two years of data collected during LIGO's fifth science run. Our results employ a Hough transform technique, introducing a chi(2) test and analysis of coincidences between the signal levels in years 1 and 2 of observations that offers a significant improvement in the product of strain sensitivity with compute cycles per data sample compared to previously published searches. Since our search yields no surviving candidates, we present results taking the form of frequency dependent, 95% confidence upper limits on the strain amplitude h(0). The most stringent upper limit from year 1 is 1.0 Chi 10(-24) in the 158.00-158.25 Hz band. In year 2, the most stringent upper limit is 8.9 Chi 10(-25) in the 146.50-146.75 Hz band. This improved detection pipeline, which is computationally efficient by at least two orders of magnitude better than our flagship Einstein@ Home search, will be important for 'quicklook' searches in the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detector era.",M & A,690
D,"Diversity, distribution and quantification of antibiotic resistance genes in goat and lamb slaughterhouse surfaces and meat products",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/diversity-distribution-and-quantification-of-antibiotic-resistanc,"The distribution and quantification of tetracycline, sulfonamide and beta-lactam
resistance genes were assessed in slaughterhouse zones throughout meat chain
production and the meat products; this study represents the first to report quantitatively monitor antibiotic resistance genes (ARG) in goat and lamb slaughterhouse using a culture independent approach, since most studies focused on individual bacterial species and their specific resistance types. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) revealed a high prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes tetA and tetB in almost all slaughterhouse zones. Sulfonamide resistance genes were largely distributed, while beta-lactam resistance genes were less predominant. Statistical analysis revealed that resistant bacteria, in most cases, were spread by the same route in almost all slaughterhouse zones, except for tetB, blaCTX and blaTEM genes, which occurred in few zones as isolated 'hot spots'. The sum of all analyzed ARG indicated that slaughterhouse surfaces and end products act as reservoirs of ARG, mainly tet genes, which were more prevalent in slaughtering room (SR), cutting room (CR) and commercial meat products (MP). Resistance gene patterns suggest they were disseminated throughout slaughterhouse zones being also detected in commercial meat products, with significant correlations between different sampling zones/end products and total resistance in SR, CR and white room (WR) zones, and also refrigerator 4 (F4) and MP were observed. Strategically controlling key zones in slaughterhouse (SR, CR and WR) by adequate disinfection methods could strategically reduce the risks of ARG transmission and minimize the issues of food safety and environment contamination.",B & C,228

E,Fault ride-through for a smart rotor DQ-axis controlled wind turbine with a jammed trailing edge flap,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/fault-ride-through-for-a-smart-rotor-dq-axis-controlled-wind-turb,"A Smart Rotor wind turbine is able to reduce fatigue loads by deploying active aerodynamic devices along the span of the blades, which can lead to a reduced cost of energy. However, a major drawback is the complexity and potential for unreliability of the system. Faults can cause catastrophic damage and without compensation would require shutdown of the turbine, resulting in lost revenue. This is the first study to look at a fault ride-through solution to avoid shutdown of the turbine and lost revenue during a fault, while keeping additional damage to a minimum. A worst case scenario of a jammed flap with no direct knowledge of its occurrence is considered, while operating a DQ-axis Smart Rotor wind turbine. A method for detecting the fault using 1P cyclic loadings is presented, as well as two fault ride-through options: setting the remaining active flap angles to zero and setting the remaining flap angles to that of the jammed flap if known. These are analysed using IEC standard load cases. It is found that rapid detection of faults is vital for Smart Rotor controllers to avoid highly damaging cyclic loads caused by rotor imbalance, but that fault ride-through is fairly simple to implement and this allows the load benefits of the Smart Rotor to be accessible even with long fault periods.",E & F,649
C,Balanced budget multipliers for small open regions within a federal system: evidence from the Scottish variable rate of income tax,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/balanced-budget-multipliers-for-small-open-regions-within-a-feder,"This paper explores the impact on aggregate economic activity in a small, open region of an income tax funded expansion in public consumption that has no direct supply-side effects. The conventional balanced budget multiplier produces an unambiguously positive macroeconomic stimulus, but the incorporation of negative competitiveness elements, through the operation of the local labor market, renders this positive outcome less certain. Simulation using a single-region Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for Scotland demonstrates that the creation of local amenity effects, and the extent to which these are incorporated into local wage bargaining, is central to the analysis.",H & J,219
C,Dynamic oscillatory signatures of central neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dynamic-oscillatory-signatures-of-central-neuropathic-pain-in-spi,"Central Neuropathic Pain (CNP) is believed to be accompanied by increased activation of the sensory and motor cortices. Our knowledge on this interaction is based mainly on fMRI studies, but there is little direct evidence on how these changes manifest in terms of dynamic neuronal activity. This study reports on the presence of transient EEG based measures of brain activity during motor imagery in spinal cord injured patients with CNP. We analyse dynamic EEG responses during imaginary movements of arms and legs in 3 groups of 10 volunteers each, comprising able-bodied people, paraplegic patients with CNP (lower abdomen and legs) and paraplegic patients without CNP. Paraplegic patients with CNP had increased event-related desynchronisation in the theta, alpha and beta bands (16-24 Hz) during imagination of movement of both non-painful (arms) and painful limbs (legs). Compared to patients with CNP, paraplegics with no pain showed a much reduced power in relaxed state and reduced event-related desynchronisation during imagination of movement. Understanding these complex dynamic, frequency-specific activations in CNP in the absence of nociceptive stimuli could inform the design of interventional therapies for patients suffering from CNP and possibly further understanding of the mechanisms involved.",L & K & C,270
D,Lifetime exposure to ambient ultraviolet radiation and the risk for cataract extraction and age-related macular degeneration: the Alienor Study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/lifetime-exposure-to-ambient-ultraviolet-radiation-and-the-risk-f,"While exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is a recognized risk factor for cataract, its association is more controversial with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We report the associations of lifetime exposure to ambient UVR with cataract extraction and AMD. The Alienor Study is a population-based study of 963 residents of Bordeaux (France), aged 73 years or more. Lifetime exposure to ambient UVR was estimated from residential history and Eurosun satellite-based estimations of ground UVR. It was divided in three groups (lower quartile, intermediate quartiles, upper quartile), using the intermediate quartiles as the reference. Early and late AMD was classified from retinal color photographs. Cataract extraction was defined as absence of the natural lens at slit-lamp. After multivariate adjustment, subjects in the upper quartile of lifetime ambient UVR exposure were at increased risk for cataract extraction (odds ratio [OR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-2.26; P = 0.03) and for early AMD (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.04-2.44; P = 0.03), by comparison with subjects in the intermediate quartiles. Subjects in the lower quartile of UVR exposure also were at increased risk for early AMD (OR = 1.69; 95% CI, 1.06-2.69; P = 0.03), by comparison with those with medium exposure. Associations of late AMD with UVR exposure was not statistically significant. This study further confirms the increased risk for cataract extraction in subjects exposed to high ambient UVR. Moreover, it suggests that risk for early AMD is increased in subjects exposed to high UVR, but also to low UVR, by comparison with medium exposures.",A & D,467

Such periodic orbits can be used to model both trojan exoplanetary systems and parking orbits for captured asteroids within the solar system. For n = 2 there are two families of periodic orbits associated with the equilibria of the system: the well known horseshoe and tadpole orbits. For n = 3 there are three families that emanate from the equilibrium configurations of the satellites, while for n = 4 there are six such families as well as numerous additional connecting families. The families of periodic orbits are all of the horseshoe or tadpole type, and several have regions of neutral linear stability.",F & L & B,943
A,Cost-sensitive adaboost algorithm for ordinal regression based on extreme learning machine,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cost-sensitive-adaboost-algorithm-for-ordinal-regression-based-on,"In this paper, the well known stagewise additive modeling using a multiclass exponential (SAMME) boosting algorithm is extended to address problems where there exists a natural order in the targets using a cost-sensitive approach. The proposed ensemble model uses an extreme learning machine (ELM) model as a base classifier (with the Gaussian kernel and the additional regularization parameter). The closed form of the derived weighted least squares problem is provided, and it is employed to estimate analytically the parameters connecting the hidden layer to the output layer at each iteration of the boosting algorithm. Compared to the state-of-the-art boosting algorithms, in particular those using ELM as base classifier, the suggested technique does not require the generation of a new training dataset at each iteration. The adoption of the weighted least squares formulation of the problem has been presented as an unbiased and alternative approach to the already existing ELM boosting techniques. Moreover, the addition of a cost model for weighting the patterns, according to the order of the targets, enables the classifier to tackle ordinal regression problems further. The proposed method has been validated by an experimental study by comparing it with already existing ensemble methods and ELM techniques for ordinal regression, showing competitive results.",E,123
B,Solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/solar-sail-periodic-orbits-in-the-earth-moon-three-body-problem,"Solar sailing has been proposed for a range of novel space applications, including hovering above the ecliptic for high-latitude observations of the Earth and monitoring the Sun from a sub-L1 position for space weather forecasting. These applications, and many others, are all defined in the Sun-Earth three-body problem, while little research has been conducted to investigate the potential of solar sailing in the Earth-Moon three-body problem. This paper therefore aims to find solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem, in particular Lagrange-point orbits. By introducing a solar sail acceleration to the Earth-Moon three-body problem, the system becomes non-autonomous and constraints on the orbital period need to be imposed. In this paper, the problem is solved as a two-point boundary value problem together with a continuation approach: starting from a natural Lagrange-point orbit, the solar sail acceleration is gradually increased and the result for the previous sail performance is used as an initial guess for a slightly better sail performance. Three in-plane steering laws are considered for the sail, two where the attitude of the sail is fixed in the synodic reference frame (perpendicular to the Earth-Moon line) and one where the sail always faces the Sun. The results of the paper include novel families of solar sail Lyapunov and Halo orbits around the Earth-Moon L1 and L2 Lagrange points, respectively. These orbits are double-revolution orbits that wind around or are off-set with respect to the natural Lagrange-point orbit. Finally, the effect of an out-of-plane solar sail acceleration component and that of the Sun-sail configuration is investigated, giving rise to additional families of solar sail periodic orbits in the Earth-Moon three-body problem.",A,693
A,"Modelling and comparing the seasonal and diurnal components of electricity demand, wind speed, wave height and wave period; for the Isles of Lewis and Harris",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/modelling-and-comparing-the-seasonal-and-diurnal-components-of-el,"The location of the Isles of Lewis and Harris, off the west coast of mainland Scotland, is favourable for the generation of renewable electricity from both the wind and ocean waves. However the islands’ position on the UK electrical grid’s periphery, with restricted local network capacity and only a limited connection to 
the mainland, makes it more challenging to capitalise on this advantage. This study sought to explore the relationship between the local wind and wave resources and consider how they track the islands’ indigenous demand for electricity. This was accomplished by using a mixture of Fourier analysis and auto-regressive techniques to model and de-trend local electricity demand 
data gathered over a 365 day period; and similarly process the wave and wind parameters associated with renewable generation, obtained from Hebridean metrological measurements recorded over the same interval. Results confirm that due to the partially complimentary relationship between wind and wave power, balancing generation across these sources is more likely to be efficient at matching customer demand, rather than a reliance on electricity from wind power alone. This would seem particularly significant for relatively isolated networks with only limited local network capacity and modest quantities of conventional 
generation available to balance any fluctuations in renewable supply. In conclusion, for the Isles of Lewis and Harris over the 365 day period studied, where grid capacity is restricted and such resources are available, it appears advantageous in terms of network efficiency to combine generation from 
wind and wave sources.",G & H,521
A,Scientific mission to a solar polar orbit using solar sail propulsion,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/scientific-mission-to-a-solar-polar-orbit-using-solar-sail-propul,"Solar sail propelled missions to a polar orbit of the Sun offer unique science opportunities. Previous proposals have recommended the use of a 2-phase transfer to reach a solar polar orbit, however a 3-phase transfer has since been shown to offer a significant reduction in the transfer time at the expense of higher thermal stresses. The 3-phase transfer involves spiralling in close to the Sun, performing a rapid inclination increase, and spiralling back out to the final target orbit. A general perturbation solution for such a transfer has been defined which offers significant advantages over the numerically optimised solutions currently available. The insights provided by this analytical solution are used here to rapidly generate a holistic understanding of the mission architecture options available and hence how the mission and system design could be traded. A number of potential science missions are identified which could benefit uniquely from the use of such an orbit. These require that a solar latitude of 60° be achieved within 5 years before proceeding to a true polar orbit. A comparison between the use of the 2- and 3-phase transfer options identify that in real terms, the 3-phase transfer will reach a polar orbit approximately 1 year ahead of the 2-phase transfer. In addition, the increased efficiency of the transfer would allow for an increase in the allowable
payload mass; with up to an extra 33kg payload potential predicted. Further work should allow for the mission and system design to be traded; for example to investigate the implications of increased thermal system mass (due to a reduction in the minimum solar approach distance) against reduced transfer time or sail size.",I & C & M,425
B,How to keep your neighbours in order,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/how-to-keep-your-neighbours-in-order,"I present a datatype-generic treatment of recursive container types whose elements are guaranteed to be stored in increasing order, with the ordering invariant rolled out systematically. Intervals, lists and binary search trees are instances of the generic treatment. On the journey to this treatment, I report a variety of failed experiments and the transferable learning experiences they triggered. I demonstrate that a total element ordering is enough to deliver insertion and flattening algorithms, and show that (with care about the formulation of the types) the implementations remain as usual. Agda's instance arguments and pattern synonyms maximize the proof search done by the typechecker and minimize the appearance of proofs in program text, often eradicating them entirely. Generalizing to indexed recursive container types, invariants such as size and balance can be expressed in addition to ordering. By way of example, I implement insertion and deletion for 2-3 trees, ensuring both order and balance by the discipline of type checking.",L,554
B,Nanopropulsion by biocatalytic self-assembly,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/nanopropulsion-by-biocatalytic-self-assembly,"A number of organisms and organelles are capable of self-propulsion at the micro- and nanoscales. Production of simple man-made mimics of biological transportation systems may prove relevant to achieving movement in artificial cells and nano/micronscale robotics that may be of biological and nanotechnological importance. We demonstrate the propulsion of particles based on catalytically controlled molecular self-assembly and fiber formation at the particle surface. Specifically, phosphatase enzymes (acting as the engine) are conjugated to a quantum dot (the vehicle), and are subsequently exposed to micellar aggregates (fuel) that upon biocatalytic dephosphorylation undergo fibrillar self-assembly, which in turn causes propulsion. The motion of individual enzyme/quantum dot conjugates is followed directly using fluorescence microscopy. While overall movement remains random, the enzymeconjugates exhibit significantly faster transport in the presence of the fiber forming system, compared to controls without fuel, a non-self-assembling substrate, or a substrate which assembles into spherical, rather than fibrous structures upon enzymatic dephosphorylation. When increasing the concentration of the fiber-forming fuel, the speed of the conjugates increases compared to non-self-assembling substrate, although directionality remains random.",B & H,773

Compared with the commonly used Complete Electrode Model (CEM), which assumes ideal front-end interfaces, the proposed model considers the effects of non-ideal components in the front-end circuits. This introduces an extra boundary condition in the forward model and offers a more accurate modelling for EIT systems. We have demonstrated its performance using simple geometry structures and compared the results with the CEM and full Maxwell methods. The IEM can provide a significantly more accurate approximation than the CEM in the MHz frequency range, where the full Maxwell methods are favoured over the quasi-static approximation. The improved electrode model will facilitate the future characterization and front-end design of real-world EIT systems.",E & F & G,127

Undergraduate students that join VIP teams earn academic credit for their participation in discovery and design efforts that assist faculty and graduate students with research and development issues in their areas of technical expertise. The teams are: multidisciplinary – drawing students from across campus; vertically integrated – maintaining a mix of sophomores through PhD students each semester; and long-term – each undergraduate student may participate in a project for up to three years. The continuity, technical depth, and disciplinary breadth of these teams enable the completion of projects of significant benefit to faculty members’ research programs.
	We compare the implementations and success of VIP Programs at five different institutions by a variety of criteria, including: origin and type of implementation strategy; number of disciplines involved; type of institution; implementation in the curriculum; resources and support available; growth of the program; grading/assessment strategy and tools; relationship with other discovery and design programs; software tools for program administration; number of students and faculty involved; etc. While programmatic variations and support have a marked effect on the success of VIP at each institution, its implementation in the curriculum and the ease of scheduling and timetabling teams stand out as two of the most important issues for every VIP site. The common slow pace of curricular change and the variability of curricular implementations across disciplines and institutions, lead to specific recommendations and strategies for future growth and dissemination of the VIP Program.",H,367

Since its origin, the field of analytics has been strongly business-oriented, with a typical focus on data-driven decision processes. In public decisions, however, issues such as individual and social values, culture and public engagement are more important and, to a large extent, characterise the policy cycle of design, testing, implementation, evaluation and review of public policies. Therefore public policy making seems to be a much more socially complex process than has hitherto been considered by most analytics methods and applications. In this paper, we thus suggest a framework for the use of analytics in supporting the policy cycle—and conceptualise it as ‘‘Policy Analytics’’.",K & L & M,193

The two pulses were both amplified in different beamlines of a Nd:glass laser system, had a central wavelength of 1054 nm and a spectral bandwidth of 2 nm, and crossed each other in an underdense plasma in a counter-propagating geometry, off-set by 10∘. It is shown that the energy transfer and the wavelength of the generated Brillouin peak depend on the plasma density, the intensity of the laser pulses, and the competition between two-plasmon decay and stimulated Raman scatter instabilities. The highest obtained energy transfer from pump to probe pulse is 2.5%, at a plasma density of 0.17ncr, and this energy transfer increases significantly with plasma density. Therefore, our results suggest that much higher efficiencies can be obtained when higher densities (above 0.25ncr) are used.",M & A,815

A,Transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine dendrimer for targeted gene delivery to the brain,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/transferrin-bearing-polypropylenimine-dendrimer-for-targeted-gene,"The possibility of using genes as medicines to treat brain diseases is currently limited by the lack of safe and efficacious delivery systems able to cross the blood-brain barrier, thus resulting in a failure to reach the brain after intravenous administration. On the basis that iron can effectively reach the brain by using transferrin receptors for crossing the blood-brain barrier, we propose to investigate if a transferrin-bearing generation 3-polypropylenimine dendrimer would allow the transport of plasmid DNA to the brain after intravenous administration. In vitro, the conjugation of transferrin to the polypropylenimine dendrimer increased the DNA uptake by bEnd.3 murine brain endothelioma cells overexpressing transferrin receptors, by about 1.4-fold and 2.3-fold compared to that observed with the non-targeted dendriplex and naked DNA. This DNA uptake appeared to be optimal following 2h incubation with the treatment. In vivo, the intravenous injection of transferrin-bearing dendriplex more than doubled the gene expression in the brain compared to the unmodified dendriplex, while decreasing the non-specific gene expression in the lung. Gene expression was at least 3-fold higher in the brain than in any tested peripheral organs and was at its highest 24h following the injection of the treatments. These results suggest that transferrin-bearing polypropylenimine dendrimer is a highly promising gene delivery system to the brain.",B & C & D,441

The present study aimed to address these limitations and examine longitudinal associations between obesity in adolescence and academic attainment. Associations between weight status at 11 years old and academic attainment assessed by national tests at 11, 13 and 16 years were examined in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Healthy weight was defined as body mass index (BMI) Z-score <1.04; overweight as BMI Z-score 1.04-1.63; obesity as BMI Z-score 1.64.  Data from 5966 participants with objectively measured weight status were examined: 71.4% were healthy weight (1935 males; 2325 females), 13.3% overweight (372 males; 420 females) and 15.3% obese (448 males; 466 females).  Girls obese at 11 years had lower academic attainment at 11, 13 and 16 years compared with those of a healthy weight, even after controlling for a wide range of confounders. Associations between obesity and academic attainment were less clear in boys. The potential mediating effects of depressive symptoms, intelligence quotient (IQ) and age of menarche in girls were explored, but when confounders were included, there was no strong evidence for mediation.  For girls, obesity in adolescence has a detrimental impact on academic attainment 5 years later. Mental health, IQ and age of menarche did not mediate this relationship, suggesting that further work is required to understand the underlying mechanisms. Parents, education and public health policy makers should consider the wide reaching detrimental impact of obesity on educational outcomes in this age group.",E & F,891
C,Can authorities appreciably enhance the prescribing of oral generic risperidone to conserve resources? findings from across Europe and their implications,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/can-authorities-appreciably-enhance-the-prescribing-of-oral-gener,"Generic atypical antipsychotic drugs offer health authorities opportunities for considerable savings. However, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders are complex diseases that require tailored treatments. Consequently, generally there have been limited demand-side measures by health authorities to encourage the preferential prescribing of generics. This is unlike the situation with hypertension, hypercholaesterolaemia or acid-related stomach disorders.The objectives of this study were to compare the effect of the limited demand-side measures in Western European countries and regions on the subsequent prescribing of risperidone following generics; to utilise the findings to provide future guidance to health authorities; and where possible, to investigate the utilisation of generic versus originator risperidone and the prices for generic risperidone.

Principally, this was a segmented regression analysis of retrospective time-series data of the effect of the various initiatives in Belgium, Ireland, Scotland and Sweden following the introduction of generic risperidone. The study included patients prescribed at least one atypical antipsychotic drug up to 20 months before and up to 20 months after generic risperidone. In addition, retrospective observational studies were carried out in Austria and Spain (Catalonia) from 2005 to 2011 as well as one English primary care organisation (Bury Primary Care Trust (PCT)).

There was a consistent steady reduction in risperidone as a percentage of total selected atypical antipsychotic utilisation following generics. A similar pattern was seen in Austria and Spain, with stable utilisation in one English PCT. However, there was considerable variation in the utilisation of generic risperidone, ranging from 98% of total risperidone in Scotland to only 14% in Ireland. Similarly, the price of generic risperidone varied considerably. In Scotland, generic risperidone was only 16% of pre-patent loss prices versus 72% in Ireland.

Consistent findings of no increased prescribing of risperidone post generics with limited specific demand-side measures suggests no 'spillover' effect from one class to another encouraging the preferential prescribing of generic atypical antipsychotic drugs. This is exacerbated by the complexity of the disease area and differences in the side-effects between treatments. There appeared to be no clinical issues with generic risperidone, and prices inversely reflected measures to enhance their utilisation.",H & J,914

The recent indicators of slowing demand both at home and abroad, falling real wages, rising levels of household debt, the prospect of more substantial UK fiscal austerity to come, and the deeper concerns about secular stagnation raise several questions.

A,"Complex incremental sheet forming using back die support on aluminium 2024, 5083 and 7075 alloys",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/complex-incremental-sheet-forming-using-back-die-support-on-alumi,"The complex prototype forming of an industrial component was investigated on AA2024, 5083 and 7075 sheets using the incremental sheet forming approach. Fracture occurred at the top of crevice and steeper wall angle region for AA2024 and 7075, respectively, whereas no fracture in the AA5083 alloy. Thinning was higher at the steeper wall angle for all the alloys, from both the experimental and finite element analysis. It is speculated that the typical tensile nature of loading and the associated thinning of the material at these regions caused plastic instability in the material thereby creating micro-cracks that resulted in the failure of the component.",E,303
B,Measuring the angular emission of optical vortex beams from integrated devices,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/measuring-the-angular-emission-of-optical-vortex-beams-from-integ,"Orbital angular momentum (OAM) represents an additional degree of freedom of a light beam, to be added to the standard ones (e.g. polarization, wavelength) [1-2]. Previously, we have demonstrated an integrated device for OAM generation, in which the Whispering Gallery mode (WGM) of the micro-ring resonator to a propagating OAM mode by using an angular grating embedded within the resonator structure [3]. This integrated approach allows compact device footprint and OAM mode order selectivity with injection wavelength, which is highly desirable for telecommunications systems. To bring OAM closer to actual system implementations, several groups around the world are working on the development of optical fibres for propagation of multiplexed OAM modes. In order to achieve efficient coupling between OAM beams and OAM fibres, it is important to obtain the information of the divergence angle of the OAM beams which should be compatible with the N.A. of the fibres. In this work, we use Fourier image inspection [4] of the emission of the device to analyse the divergence angles of the OAM beams.",A,757

Ammonia was successfully synthesised from wet hydrogen and dry nitrogen at atmospheric pressure using Co3Mo3N–Ag composite as cathode, Ag–Pd alloy as anode and LiAlO2–(Li/Na/K)2CO3 composite as an electrolyte. Ammonia formation was investigated at 400, 425 and 450 °C, and the maximum observed ammonia formation rate was 3.27×10−10 mol s−1 cm−2 at 450 °C when applied at 0.8 V. The catalytic activity of Co3Mo3N for electrochemical ammonia synthesis is lower than that of Pd.

B,The effects of work experience during higher education on labour market entry: learning by doing or an entry ticket?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effects-of-work-experience-during-higher-education-on-labour-,"Graduates from higher education often enter the labour market with a considerable amount of work experience. Using German data, we address the question of whether early work experience pays off upon labour market entry. We compare the labour market benefits of different types of work experience. This comparison allows us to more generally test hypotheses about different explanations of why education pays off. Results indicate that tertiary graduates do not profit from work experience that is unrelated to the field of study or was a mandatory part of the study programme. Even though field-related and voluntary work experience helps graduates to realize a fast integration into the labour market, it is not linked to higher chances for entering a favourable class position or to higher wages in the long run. These results provide evidence for the signalling explanation of educational benefits in the labour market rather than the human capital explanation.",L,248

By placing the GaN nanowires onto gold substrates, the naturally occurring randomly orientated elliptical polarization of nanowire lasers is converted to a linear polarization that is oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Confirmed by simulation results, this polarization control is attributed to a polarization-dependent loss induced by the gold substrate, which breaks the mode degeneracy of the nanowire and forms two orthogonally polarized modes with largely different cavity losses.",D & L,670

testing as conventional spacecraft, they have a greater risk of failure. In this paper we address the problem of attitude control of a nano-spacecraft that experiences different types of faults. Based on the traditional quaternion feedback control method, an adaptive fault-tolerant control method is developed, which can ensure that the control system still operates when the actuator fault happens. This paper derives the fault-tolerant control logic under both actuator gain fault mode and actuator deviation fault mode. Taking the parameters of the UKube-1 in the simulation model, a comparison between a traditional spacecraft control method and the adaptive fault-tolerant control method in the presence of a fault is undertaken. It is shown that the proposed controller copes with faults and is able to complete an effective attitude control manoeuver in the presence of a fault.",A & B & C & D,269

D,Dual nanoparticle amplified surface plasmon resonance detection of thrombin at subattomolar concentrations,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dual-nanoparticle-amplified-surface-plasmon-resonance-detection-o,A novel dual nanoparticle amplification approach is introduced for the enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection of a target protein at subattomolar concentrations. Thrombin was used as a model target protein as part of a sandwich assay involving an antithrombin (anti-Th) modified SPR chip surface and a thrombin specific DNA aptamer (Th-aptamer) whose sequence also includes a polyadenine (A30) tail. Dual nanoparticle (NP) enhancement was achieved with the controlled hybridization adsorption of first polythymine-NP conjugates (T20-NPs) followed by polyadenine-NPs (A30-NPs). Two different nanoparticle shapes (nanorod and quasi-spherical) were explored resulting in four different NP pair combinations being directly compared. It was found that both the order and NP shape were important in optimizing the assay performance. The use of real-time SPR measurements to detect target concentrations as low as 0.1 aM is a 10-fold improvement compared to single NP-enhanced SPR detection methods.,I & J,800

To meet the IMO proposed target of 20% CO2 reduction from shipping by 2020, proposal of solidifying CO2 separated from engine exhaust had been made and tested by the authors. Laboratory experiment [1] on CO2 absorption has illustrated the feasibility of solidifying carbon onboard ships. To further verify the accuracy of results from CO2 absorption experiment, simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) of the CO2 absorption and solidification processes is carried out, including system modelling and meshing, reactions simulating and post-CFD treatments. Eulerian multiphase model and species transport model are applied for the simulation. These models will present the interaction between gas phase (CO2) and chemical solution in both physical phase interactions and chemical reactions between the species.

In particular we conducted an evaluation with varying interaction techniques which looked at non-visual touch based exploration of information on a capacitive surface. The results of this evaluation indicate that there is very little difference in terms of selection accuracy between the interaction techniques that we implemented and a slight but significant time reduction when using multiple fingers to search, over one finger.

The remaining 95 were non ADHD Community Comparisons. Results: Analyses supported a three-factor model, with a reduced item pool, which combined the Harm Avoidance and Separation Anxiety scales together. This model was invariant across younger and older participants, and across boys and girls. The model was largely invariant across ADHD and non-ADHD groups.

E,DC fault parameter sensitivity analysis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dc-fault-parameter-sensitivity-analysis,"At present High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Voltage Source Converters (VSC) are susceptible dc faults leading to extreme currents. The fault current cannot be controlled by the converter switching flows in the anti-parallel diodes. Protection devices are, therefore, required to operate with sufficient speed to avoid device failure. A method is introduced to calculate the critical time for protection to operate. Using this method it is then shown how the critical time may be extended by way of optimization of passive system components. In order to perform this optimization a new post-fault (when the converter gating signals are inhibited) model of the Modular Multi-Level (MMC) converter is introduced which drastically reduces simulation time, allowing high resolution parameter sweeps to be performed. The model is validated and is shown to produce fault characteristics similar to that of a conventional switched model.",E & F,515

Invented in Berlin in the late 1920s, by the mid 1930s a diagnostic laboratory in Edinburgh was performing thousands of tests every year for doctors around Britain. In her classic history of antenatal care, sociologist Ann Oakley claimed that the Aschheim–Zondek test launched a ‘modern era’ of obstetric knowledge, which asserted its superiority over that of pregnant women. This article reconsiders Oakley’s claim by examining how pregnancy testing worked in practice. It explains the British adoption of the test in terms less of the medicalisation of pregnancy than of clinicians’ increasing general reliance on laboratory services for differential diagnosis. Crucially, the Aschheim–Zondek reaction was a test not directly for the fetus, but for placental tissue. It was used, less as a yes-or-no test for ordinary pregnancy, than as a versatile diagnostic tool for the early detection of malignant tumours and hormonal deficiencies believed to cause miscarriage. This test was as much a product of oncology and the little-explored world of laboratory services as of reproductive medicine.",H & J,378
C,Fraser of Allander Institute: Economic Commentary [March 2014],https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/fraser-of-allander-institute-economic-commentary-march-2014,"The latest economic data provide further evidence of a strengthening recovery. Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the last 6 quarters. In the third quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below the pre-recession peak, whereas UK G DP stood at -1.9% below its pre-recession peak more than 5 years ago. But during 2013, the UK recovery has again been stronger in each of the three quarters of published data so far. When oil and gas production is removed from the UK figures to make UK GDP comparable to the Scottish data, which do not include offshore production we find that the long period of weak oil and gas production has resulted in the UK GDP - ex oil & gas - having a much stronger recovery from recession than Scottish GDP. Scottish GD P has recovered by 4.9% since the trough of recession while UK GDP - ex oil & gas - has recovered by 6.8% from its trough. At the industry level, Scottish services' growth is underperforming the overall performance of the economy in the recovery whereas that is not the case in the UK where the recovery in services has been somewhat quicker. It is the production sector that has boosted Scottish growth, growing by nearly 10% in the recovery while it has been a significant drag on the recovery in the UK with zero growth since the trough of the recession, which is partly a consequence of the weakness of oil & gas production on the UK production and GDP figures. It is the performance of manufacturing that is the main driver of the differential performance in production between Scotland and the UK. Scottish manufacturing GVA continues to stand at - 4.6% below the 2008 -09 pre- recession peak, while the figure for UK manufacturing has dropped slightly to -9% from - 9.8% in the second quarter. The favourable gap between Scotland and UK manufacturing performance during the recovery therefore continues to be large. In Scottish construction whi le growth in the sector has picked up since the heavy recession period of 2010q4 to 2012q1 performance appears to have weakened relative to the UK from the start of last year. The sector is still very much depressed in both the UK and Scotland. However, the recent stronger performance of UK construction is evident with GVA in the sector in the third quarter -10.9% below its pre -recession peak compared to -13.6% in Scotland. Business and financial services continue to contribute positively to the growth of t he Scottish economy. By the latest quarter, the sector in the UK had moved to +1.3% above its pre-recession peak from -0.4% in the previous quarter, while its Scottish counterpart moved further ahead to stand at 2.2% above its pre-recession peak.

D,A symmetry preserving algorithm for matrix scaling,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-symmetry-preserving-algorithm-for-matrix-scaling,"We present an iterative algorithm which asymptotically scales the $\infty$-norm of each row and each column of a matrix to one. This scaling algorithm preserves symmetry of the original matrix and shows fast linear convergence with an asymptotic rate of 1/2. We discuss extensions of the algorithm to the 1-norm, and by inference to other norms. For the 1-norm case, we show again that convergence is linear, with the rate dependent on the spectrum of the scaled matrix. We demonstrate experimentally that the scaling algorithm improves the conditioning of the matrix and that it helps direct solvers by reducing the need for pivoting. In particular, for symmetric matrices the theoretical and experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed algorithm over existing alternatives.",A & D,437

Her informal transatlantic alliance with U.S. President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1989 played an important role in the promotion of an international neoliberal policy agenda that remains influential today. Her critique of UK social democracy during the 1970s and her adoption of key neoliberal strategies, such as financial deregulation, trade liberalization, and the privatization of public goods and services, were popularly labeled Thatcherism. In this article, we consider the nature of Thatcherism and its impact on health and well-being during her period as prime minister and, to a lesser extent, in the years that follow; we focus mainly on Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales). Thatcher's policies were associated with substantial increases in socioeconomic and health inequalities: these issues were actively marginalized and ignored by her governments.

B,Social capital and modern language initiatives in times of policy uncertainty,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/social-capital-and-modern-language-initiatives-in-times-of-policy,"Language professionals across the United Kingdom have long been apprehensive about low levels of participation in language learning, as well as disparities in gender and social class of language learners. However, the distinct policy contexts in England and in Scotland have led to divergent [re]actions with regard to this common concern.  This article traces the policy paths taken by the respective governments since the start of the 21st century. The development and impact of a major funding programme in England, the ‘Routes into Languages’ initiative, are outlined, assessed and contrasted with the situation in Scotland.  Using Putnam’s notion of social capital (durable networks between people from different social groupings) as a powerful means to implement change the authors demonstrate that in England considerable and beneficial links across previous educational divides have developed as part of the ‘Routes’ initiative, despite the continuing threat of transient policy contexts. In Scotland, the implementation phase of the new 1+2 languages policy might provide the impetus to develop a comparable initiative to ‘Routes’.  Arguably, a sea change in attitudes to language learning is unlikely to happen without durable and sustainable social capital between staff in school and university.",A,270
A,A two-stage heuristic approach for nurse scheduling problem: a case study in an emergency department,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-two-stage-heuristic-approach-for-nurse-scheduling-problem-a-cas,"Nurse scheduling is a critical issue in the management of emergency department. Under the intense work environment, it is imperative to make quality nurse schedules in a most cost and time effective way. To this end, a spreadsheet-based two-stage heuristic approach is proposed for the nurse scheduling problem (NSP) in a local emergency department. First, an initial schedule satisfying all hard constraints is generated by the simple shift assignment heuristic. Second, the sequential local search algorithm is employed to improve the initial schedules by taking soft constraints (nurse preferences) into account. The proposed approach is benchmarked with the existing approach and 0-1 programming. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it is one of a few studies in nurse scheduling literature using heuristic approach to generate nurse schedules based on Excel spreadsheet. Therefore, users with little knowledge on linear programming and computer sciences can operate and change the scheduling algorithms easily. Second, while most studies on nurse scheduling are situated in hospitals, this paper attempts to bridge the research gap by investigating the NSP in the emergency department where the scheduling rules are much more restrictive due to the intense and dynamic work environment. Overall, our approach generates satisfactory schedules with higher level of user-friendliness, efficiency, and flexibility of rescheduling as compared to both the existing approach and 0-1 programming.",G & H,532

Ethical approval and informed consent were obtained for this Phase I clinical study. Patients with advanced solid tumours refractory to conventional therapy were recruited and given L-NNA intravenously at two different dose levels. Volumetric perfusion CT scans were carried out at 1, 24, 48 & 72 hours post L-NNA. Blood pressures were taken at regular interval for 6 hours after LNNA. L-NNA was well tolerated by the four patients who received it. Blood flow (BF) and blood vo-lume (BV) in both tumour and kidney were reduced post L-NNA administration (renal BF—20%; renal BV— 19.7%; tumour BF—16.9%; tumour BV—18.6%), though the effect was more sustained in tumour vasculature. A negative correlation was found between the change in systemic blood pressure and vascular supply to the tu-mour within 1 hour following L-NNA (p < 0.0001). Differences in response to L-NNA by separate target lesions in the same patient were observed. The differential effect of L-NNA on tumour and renal blood flow, and the absence of any significant toxicity in this small cohort of patients permit further dose escalation of L-NNA in future early phase trials. The predictive value of blood pressure change in relation to the acute effect of L-NNA on tumour vasculature deserves further evaluation.",I & C & M,532

We tackle a specific aspect of the fundamental quantum marginal problem: we address the issue of deducing the global properties of correlations of tripartite quantum states based on the knowledge of their bipartite reductions, focusing on relating specific properties of bipartite correlations to global correlation properties. We prove that strictly classical bipartite correlations may still require global entanglement and that unentangled---albeit not strictly classical---reductions may require global genuine multipartite entanglement, rather than simple entanglement. On the other hand, for three qubits, the strict classicality of the bipartite reductions rules out the need for genuine multipartite entanglement. Our work sheds new light on the relation between local and global properties of quantum states, and on the interplay between classical and quantum properties of correlations.",L,924

C,Electron acceleration and ionization fronts induced by high frequency plasma turbulence,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/electron-acceleration-and-ionization-fronts-induced-by-high-frequ,"There are recent observations of artificial plasmas created during ionospheric modification experiments, in which intense radio waves are injected into the overhead ionosphere by ground-based transmitters. The plasma is formed just below the reflection point of the ordinary wave mode, where Langmuir and
upper hybrid turbulence take place. When the plasma builds up, the radio wave is reflected at a lower altitude, and an ionization front is formed, rapidly descending to an altitude a few tens of kilometres below the initial critical layer. The ionization of the neutral gas is attributed to collisions with energetic electrons accelerated by the plasma wave turbulence. Numerical full-scale modeling of the Langmuir turbulence, electron acceleration and transport, and ionization processes are consistent with the observations. By a similarity principle, the experiment can be scaled down from the large-scale ionosphere to a metre-scale laboratory plasma, where microwaves are used instead of radio waves to induce the plasma turbulence. Such laboratory experiments under controlled conditions are now planned at Strathclyde, and may lead to new methods for electron acceleration and plasma generation in the laboratory.",D & L,609

Even when all countries are the same size, the centrality of the hub sets it apart. We determine how this trading pattern matters, comparing it to a structure with direct trade between all countries. The implications of international tax competition are also examined.",I & J,318

B,Nanoindentation of polysiliocn and single crystal silicon: molecular dynamics simulation and experimental validation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/nanoindentation-of-polysiliocn-and-single-crystal-silicon-molecul,"This paper presents novel advances in the deformation behaviour of polycrystalline and single crystal silicon using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and validation of the same via nanoindentation experiments. In order to unravel the mechanism of deformation, four simulations were performed: indentation of a polycrystalline silicon substrate with a (i) Berkovich pyramidal and a (ii) spherical (arc) indenter, and (iii and iv) indentation of a single crystal silicon substrate with these two indenters. The simulation results reveal that high pressure phase transformation (HPPT) in silicon (Si-I to Si-II phase transformation) occurred in all cases; however, its extent and the manner in which it occurred differed significantly between polycrystalline silicon and single crystal silicon, and was the main driver of differences in the nanoindentation deformation behaviour between these two types of silicon. Interestingly, in polycrystalline silicon, the HPPT was observed to occur more preferentially along the grain boundaries than across the grain boundaries. An automated dislocation extraction algorithm (DXA) revealed no dislocations in the deformation zone, suggesting that HPPT is the primary mechanism in inducing plasticity in silicon.",M & A,398

In this paper, we create an economic model of this mechanism, and characterize the equilibrium under generic assumptions about the costs distributions of the network operators. Furthermore, the equilibrium is explicitly derived under more specific assumptions about the model; that is, two network operators and costs drawn from uniform distributions. In this case, we also characterize the expected prices the subscriber has to pay depending on their preferences about the service; for example, trading off quality for a lower price. Finally, we provide a numerical analysis of the case with more than two network operators.",H & J,399

This process is associated with inflammation, bone loss and implant loosening and led to the withdrawal from the market of the DePuy ASR™ MoM hip replacements in 2010. Ions released from CoCr particles derived from a resurfacing implant in vitro and their subsequent cellular up-take were measured by ICP-MS. Moreover, the ability of such metal debris and Co ions to induce both apoptosis was evaluated with both FACS and immunoblotting. qRT-PCR was used to assess the effects on the expression of lymphotoxin alpha (LTA), BCL2-associated athanogene (BAG1), nitric oxide synthase 2 inducible (NOS2), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS), growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible alpha (GADD45A). ICP-MS showed that the wear debris released significant (p < 0.05) amounts of Co and Cr ions into the culture medium, and significant (p < 0.05) cellular uptake of both ions. There was also an increase (p < 0.05) in apoptosis after a 48 h exposure to wear debris. Analysis of qRT-PCR results found significant up-regulation (p < 0.05) particularly of NOS2 and BAG1 in Co pre-treated cells which were subsequently exposed to Co ions + debris. Metal debris was more effective as an inducer of apoptosis and gene expression when cells had been pre-treated with Co ions. This suggests that if a patient receives sequential bilateral CoCr implants, the second implant may be more likely to produce adverse effects than the first one.",A & D,911

The CuInGa (CIG) precursors were prepared in an in-line evaporation system at room temperature, and then selenised at 500 °C. The two-step processed CIGS films were mechanically compressed at 25 MPa to improve their optoelectronic properties, which were verified by photoluminescence (PL). The surface and structural properties were compared before and after compression. The mechanical compression has brought changes in the surface morphology and porosity without changing the structural properties of the material. The PL technique has been used to reveal changes in the electronic properties of the films. PL spectra at different excitation laser powers and temperatures were measured for as-grown as well as compressed samples. The PL spectra of the as-grown films revealed three broad and intense bands shifting at a significant rate towards higher energies (j-shift) with the increase in excitation power suggesting that the material is highly doped and compensated. At increasing temperature, the bands shift towards lower energies, which is a characteristic of the band tails generated by spatial potential fluctuation. The compression increases the intensity of energy bands by an order of magnitude and reduces the j-shift, demonstrating an improvement of the electronic properties.",F & L & B,286

However as data rates increase, present technology based on well-established CMOS technology is becoming increasingly difficult to scale and consequently data networks are struggling to satisfy current network demand.

It aims to interrogate various degrees of ‘liveness’ in design pedagogy and the way in which they can be introduced in typical lecture formats. ‘Liveness’ has been recently emphasised as a ‘university without walls’ approach to teaching in studio settings but has received little or no attention as a mechanism that can be accommodated in classroom settings. Departing from communication modes such as instruction/reaction and showing/telling that rely only on knowledge consumption, the paper introduces mechanisms by which knowledge can be constructed.  It presents a number of mechanisms, which were developed by the author and were implemented through a series of exercises in various lecture-based courses in different universities. Two layers of ‘live’ are conceived; the first is an approach that aims to bring the built environment into the classroom, while the second utilises the built environment as an open textbook. Categorized under these two layers, the exercises place emphasis on critical reflection, interaction with behavioural phenomena, contemplating settings and systematic observations, behavioural mapping and active engagement. Students’ feedback and outcomes manifest the uniqueness of these approaches and their potential contribution to effective learning beyond studio settings.",A,785

Mediators are drawn from a number of disciplines and backgrounds, and do not constitute a unified cohort. This is reflected in the very varied and widely dispersed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) canon.

We find that the literature divides roughly between (a) empirical research and (b) narratives about practice and practitioners, and that the line between skills and traits is often blurred. We identify two main groupings of mediators: those who practise by virtue of their personal characteristics, discipline or profession of origin, and those whose recognised social standing, eldership or prestige within a given community qualify them to act as mediators. We also review some of the many debates and discourses at play in the field.

We find that a coherent account of mediators’ traits is still missing from the literature. This remains to be further explored, and we consider possible directions for future investigation.",I & C & M,781

B,Tissue quality assessment using a novel direct elasticity assessment device (the e-finger): a cadaveric study of prostatectomy dissection,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/tissue-quality-assessment-using-a-novel-direct-elasticity-assessm,"Introduction
Minimally invasive radical prostatectomy (RP) (robotic and laparoscopic), have brought improvements in the outcomes of RP due to improved views and increased degrees of freedom of surgical devices. Robotic and laparoscopic surgeries do not incorporate haptic feedback, which may result in complications secondary to inadequate tissue dissection (causing positive surgical margins, rhabdosphincter damage, etc). We developed a micro-engineered device (6 mm2 sized) [E-finger]) capable of quantitative elasticity assessment, with amplitude ratio, mean ratio and phase lag representing this. The aim was to assess the utility of the device in differentiating peri-prostatic tissue types in order to guide prostate dissection.
Material and Methods
Two embalmed and 2 fresh frozen cadavers were used in the study. Baseline elasticity values were assessed in bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter of pre-dissected embalmed cadavers using the micro-engineered device. A measurement grid was created to span from the bladder, across the prostate and onto the rhabdosphincter of fresh frozen cadavers to enable a systematic quantitative elasticity assessment of the entire area by 2 independent assessors. Tissue was sectioned along each row of elasticity measurement points, and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Image analysis was performed with Image Pro Premier to determine the histology at each measurement point.
Results
Statistically significant differences in elasticity were identified between bladder, prostate and sphincter in both embalmed and fresh frozen cadavers (p = <0.001). Intra-class correlation (ICC) reliability tests showed good reliability (average ICC = 0.851). Sensitivity and specificity for tissue identification was 77% and 70% respectively to a resolution of 6 mm2.
Conclusions
This cadaveric study has evaluated the ability of our elasticity assessment device to differentiate bladder, prostate and rhabdosphincter to a resolution of 6 mm2. The results provide useful data for which to continue to examine the use of elasticity assessment devices for tissue quality assessment with the aim of giving haptic feedback to surgeons performing complex surgery.",B & H,622

When complications arise, such as aortic stenosis, prognosis can be very poor, leading to death within the first few years. Surgical valve replacement is currently the standard treatment for aortic stenosis. A thorough understanding of the anatomy and function of the native valve is imperative when developing a prosthetic replacement that can withstand the complex demands of the heart. This review focuses on the anatomy, structure and disease of the aortic valve and the implications for a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Current complications with TAVR, such as major vascular bleeding, conduction disturbances and patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM), can be overcome by reducing the delivery profile and through the use of more accurate imaging technologies to work towards a fully functional and durable prosthesis.",D & L,760

It was found that the patterned polymer substrate defined nucleation sites which guided subsequent growth of nanorods. Enhanced surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) intensities of the Raman probe molecule trans-1,2-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene (BPE) were found for Ag arrays on polymer, up to about 10 times that of the Ag-silica control. The SERS response of Ag nanorod arrays of different structures was investigated alongside results obtained from discrete dipole approximation simulations. This revealed that narrow gaps between nanorods, formed by guided nucleation during OAD, were responsible for this dramatic enhancement. Ordered Cu nanorod arrays were also successfully fabricated, producing a SERS intensity about 3 times that of Cu on silicon for both BPE and another Raman probe - rhodamine B isothiocyanate (RBITC) - highlighting the potential of this large-scale, low-cost, SERS-active substrate.",B & E,224

In recent years however, significant attention has been paid to alternative insulating fluids, including synthetic and natural ester liquids. In order to expand their practical applications, it is important to have detailed information on their dielectric properties. In this present paper, the dielectric properties of synthetic ester, Midel 7131; mineral oil, Shell Diala D; and vegetable (rapeseed) oil have been investigated. It has been shown that Midel 7131 has a higher ac breakdown voltage (27.6 kV) as compared with Diala D oil (26.4 kV) and rapeseed oil (24.6 kV). However, the breakdown voltage of the Diala D oil has the smallest standard deviation (7%) amongst the tested liquids (13% for Midel 7131 and 11% for rapeseed oil). Statistical analysis of the breakdown voltages has been conducted and it has been shown that the ac breakdown voltages can be described by a normal distribution. dc I-V characteristics have been measured and the space charge saturation regime has been observed for all three liquids starting from ~9 kV for positive energisation and ~10 kV for negative energisation in the point-plane topology. Apparent mobilities of the charge carriers in the tested liquids have been obtained using I1/2-V curves; these mobilities can be used for calculation of the space charge influenced distribution of the electric field in liquid insulators stressed with dc voltage. Such analysis can be important for design and exploitation of HVDC power systems",E & F,282

In this work we use cathodoluminescence (CL) hyperspectral imaging to study InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) structures. Different types of trench defects with varying trench width, namely wide or narrow trenches forming closed loops and open loops, are investigated in the same hyperspectral CL measurement. A strong redshift (90 meV) and intensity increase of the MQW emission is demonstrated for regions enclosed by wide trenches, whereas those within narrower trenches only exhibit a small redshift (10 meV) and a slight reduction of intensity compared with the defect-free surrounding area. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that some trench defects consist of a raised central area, which is caused by an increase of about 40% in the thickness of the InGaN wells. The causes of the changes in luminescences are also discussed in relation to TEM results identifying the underlying structure of the defect. Understanding these defects and their emission characteristics is important for further enhancement and development of light-emitting diodes.",B & L,489

This paper presents the ASEM (Attitude Stabilization Electromagnetic Module) concept for detumbling debris in a low Earth orbit with the intention of mitigating risk during capture operations. This paper presents a preliminary design of a system whose purpose is to stabilize a target’s attitude, using an external module equipped with magnetorquers. The device, initially carried by the chaser spacecraft, is attached to the body of the target satellite. The magnetorquers are then used to detumble the target so that the chaser spacecraft can perform a safe approach prior to capture. A simplified model is used in the initial design phase to optimize the mass of the system and to size the torque rods and power source. Alternative methods for attaching the ASEM to the target from the chaser spacecraft are discussed. In addition a novel magnetic control law suitable for this application is presented. The feasibility of the concept is tested in simulations using a model based on Envisat (assuming that the ASEM is already attached to the target). Results show that a module weighing less than 20 kg can stabilize an 8-ton satellite initially rotating at 1 rpm in 21 days.",A & G,311

E,The tunnel of Doctus KBS: the deeper you get the darker it is,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-tunnel-of-doctus-kbs-the-deeper-you-get-the-darker-it-is,"When you are on your way inwards to a tunnel, it is getting darker and darker. You reach the darkest point when you are in the deepest. Then, as you start your way out, there is gradually more and more light. Over the last quarter century we were getting deeper and deeper in. It seems that it is starting to get lighter now.

As academics and consultants we have been working for, with and on top-level business decision takers involved in loosely structured decision problems. Gradually we have achieved better and better understanding of the models of thinking that can be useful for these decision takers. First we realized that the model of thinking needs to be simple; which is the philosophical commonplace of Occam’s razor. Somewhat later we realized that it is easy to cut our-selves if Occam’s razor is too sharp – the model of thinking must not be too simple as it will fail to provide a usable representation of reality. This is also known from philosophy as Einstein’s extension of Occam’s rule: as simple as possible but not simpler than that. Along these lines we have developed the Doctus knowledge-based system shell, for building our models. This way we started building the bridge of trans-disciplinarity between the knowledge do-mains of various experts. However, this bridge is narrow and difficult to use for crossing the disciplinary divides. Decision takers cannot walk the bridge alone; they need a bridge-guide called the knowledge engineer. The knowledge engineer is not a polymath (expert in multiple domains); the knowledge engineer’s expertise is about knowledge and knowers.

More recently we have realized that it is not sufficient if the model is useful, it also has to be usable. The bridge should be wide, stable and easy to walk. Of course, it is still nice to have the knowledge engineer to guide the decision taker – it provides a fuller experience. What makes for such bridge? Today we think that we need to apply Occam’s razor tempered by Einstein on the user interface the same way as we have previously used it for representing knowledge. The new Doctus is beautiful and as simpler as it can be – but not simpler than that.",D,963

To elaborate the challenges and explore the issues involved with autarkic energy concepts this paper reports on the output  from  a  workshop  convened  to  investigate  the  role  that  energy  autarky  might  play  in 
delivering  societies  able  to  deliver  the  ambitious  renewable  generation  targets  set  by  both Scottish and UK Governments. In addition, monitored data from a community micro-grid system in  Northern  Scotland  is  analysed  and  presented  to  provide  additional  understanding  of  the complexities and opportunities created by  an autarkic approach. The output from the workshop identified that whilst it is probable that a dogmatic interpretation of energy autarkic will not be universally  applicable,  the  underlying  principles  represent  a  bottom  up  way  of  widening participation in the development of future energy provision models. Whilst a number of issues and  barriers  were  raised  regarding  its  adoption,  the  attendees  recognised  that  energy  autarky represented  a  very  positive  and  empowering  vision  for  translating  global  scale  issues  to  local energy transition.    The analysis of monitored generation and demand data from a community micro-grid  underlined  the  problems  associated  with  supply-demand  matching  with  intermittent generation and the need to  place an emphasis on the  community or entity  as an open system that is able to participate in a full range of trading opportunities. Similarities were found between the types  of  behaviour  necessary  to  create  load  responses  relevant  to  energy  networks  containing large  penetrations  of  renewable  generation  and  communities  set  up  along  energy  autarkic principles.",E & F,929
A,Evaluating the thermal vinylcyclopropane rearrangement (VCPR) as a practical method for the synthesis of difluorinated cyclopentenes: experimental and computational studies of rearrangement stereospecificity,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluating-the-thermal-vinylcyclopropane-rearrangement-vcpr-as-a-,"Vinyl cyclopropane rearrangement (VCPR) has been utilised to synthesise a difluorinated cyclopentene stereospecifically and under mild thermal conditions. Difluorocyclopropanation chemistry afforded ethyl 3-(1'(2'2'-difluoro-3'-phenyl)cyclopropyl) propenoate as all four stereoisomers (18a, 18b, 22a, 22b) (all racemic). Trans-E isomer (18a), prepared in 70% yield over three steps, underwent near quantitative VCPR to difluorocyclopentene 23 (99%). Rearrangements  were followed by 19F NMR (100-180 °C). While cis/trans cyclopropane stereoisomerisation was facile, favouring trans-isomers by a modest margin, no E/Z alkene isomerisation was observed even at higher temperatures. Neither cis nor trans Z-alkenoates underwent VCPR, even up to much higher temperatures (180 oC). Cis-cyclopropanes underwent [3,3]-rearrangement to afford benzocycloheptadiene species. The reaction stereospecificity was explored using electronic structure calculations and UB3LYP/6-31G* methodology allowed the energy barriers for cyclopropane stereoisomerisation, diastereoisomeric VCPR and [3,3]-rearrangement to be ranked in agreement with experiment.",F & K,252
B,Analysis of the universal immunization programme and introduction of a rotavirus vaccine in India with IndiaSim,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/analysis-of-the-universal-immunization-programme-and-introduction,"India has the highest under-five death toll globally, approximately 20% of which is attributed to vaccine-preventable diseases. India's Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) is working both to increase immunization coverage and to introduce new vaccines. Here, we analyze the disease and financial burden alleviated across India's population (by wealth quintile, rural or urban area, and state) through increasing vaccination rates and introducing a rotavirus vaccine. We use IndiaSim, a simulated agent-based model (ABM) of the Indian population (including socio-economic characteristics and immunization status) and the health system to model three interventions. In the first intervention, a rotavirus vaccine is introduced at the current DPT3 immunization coverage level in India. In the second intervention, coverage of three doses of rotavirus and DPT and one dose of the measles vaccine are increased to 90% randomly across the population. In the third, we evaluate an increase in immunization coverage to 90% through targeted increases in rural and urban regions (across all states) that are below that level at baseline. For each intervention, we evaluate the disease and financial burden alleviated, costs incurred, and the cost per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted. Baseline immunization coverage is low and has a large variance across population segments and regions. Targeting specific regions can approximately equate the rural and urban immunization rates. Introducing a rotavirus vaccine at the current DPT3 level (intervention one) averts 34.7 (95% uncertainty range [UR], 31.7–37.7) deaths and $215,569 (95% UR, $207,846–$223,292) out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditure per 100,000 under-five children. Increasing all immunization rates to 90% (intervention two) averts an additional 22.1 (95% UR, 18.6–25.7) deaths and $45,914 (95% UR, $37,909–$53,920) OOP expenditure. Scaling up immunization by targeting regions with low coverage (intervention three) averts a slightly higher number of deaths and OOP expenditure. The reduced burden of rotavirus diarrhea is the primary driver of the estimated health and economic benefits in all intervention scenarios. All three interventions are cost saving. Improving immunization coverage and the introduction of a rotavirus vaccine significantly alleviates disease and financial burden in Indian households. Population subgroups or regions with low existing immunization coverage benefit the most from the intervention. Increasing coverage by targeting those subgroups alleviates the burden more than simply increasing coverage in the population at large.",M & I,693
B,Sphingosine kinase 1 enables communication between melanoma cells and fibroblasts that provides a new link to metastasis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/sphingosine-kinase-1-enables-communication-between-melanoma-cells,"In this issue of Oncogene, Albinet et al. have demonstrated a critical role of melanoma sphingosine kinase 1, which catalyses formation of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), in promoting the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. The myofibroblast sphingosine kinase 1 then promotes the S1P-dependent dissemination (metastasis) of melanoma cells via a S1P receptor 3-mediated mechanism. These findings are of major significance because they provide a novel mechanism of interaction between melanoma and the microenvironment niche in promoting metastasis. These studies therefore identify S1P derived from myofibroblasts and melanoma cells as a novel target for therapeutic intervention.",B & L,503
C,How Much Does a Single Graduation Cohort From Further Education Colleges Contribute to an Open Regional Economy?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/how-much-does-a-single-graduation-cohort-from-further-education-c,Econometric analysis has been inconclusive in determining the contribution that increased skills have on macroeconomic performance whilst conventional growth accounting approaches to the same problem rest on restrictive assumptions. We propose an alternative micro-to-macro method which combines elements of growth accounting and numerical general equilibrium modelling. The usefulness of this approach for applied education policy analysis is demonstrated by evaluating the macroeconomic impact on the Scottish economy of a single graduation cohort from further education colleges. We find the macroeconomic impact to be significant. From a policy point of view this supports a revival of interest in the conventional teaching role of education institutions.,E & A,402
A,Festival place or place of festival? The role of place identity and attachment in the festival environment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/festival-place-or-place-of-festival-the-role-of-place-identity-an,"This paper addresses place identity and attachment theory in the context of events. Viewing place as a symbolic part of the consumption process, a ""Model of Festival Place"" is developed. This advances theories that presuppose environment as nothing more than a context for consumption. Selecting the festival as a suitable event context, literature suggests that place identity and place attachment do affect consumer perceptions however, confusion exists regarding exactly how they impact the event experience. This confusion is addressed using an interpretive methodology which aims to understand the lived experience of festival-goers. Unstructured interviews are analysed using thematic analysis to demonstrate that identity and attachment do influence consumer perceptions of the festival environment however, not as first imagined. Environments become either creations of the festival or exist independently of them. The latter allows realistic place-based identities to form, resulting in experiential consonance (i.e. between festival expectations and reality). The former creates more abstract identities resulting in unrealistic expectations and as a result, immediate attachment to specific festival locations is much weaker. Continuity-based recommendations valid across numerous experiential contexts are offered, providing clearer theoretical understanding of the experiential place as well as practical suggestions to improve the consumer's experience.",A & G,464
D,Organic super-electron-donors: initiators in transition metal-free haloarene-arene coupling,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/organic-super-electron-donors-initiators-in-transition-metal-free,"Recent papers report transition metal-free couplings of haloarenes to arenes to form biaryls, triggered by alkali metal tert-butoxides in the presence of various additives. These reactions proceed through radical intermediates, but understanding the origin of the radicals has been problematic. Electron transfer from a complex formed from potassium tert-butoxide with additives, such as phenanthroline, has been suggested to initiate the radical process. However, our computational results encouraged us to search for alternatives. We report that heterocycle-derived organic electron donors achieve the coupling reactions and these donors can form in situ in the above cases. We show that an electron transfer route can operate either with phenanthrolines as additives or using pyridine as solvent, and we propose new heterocyclic structures for the respective electron donors involved in these cases. In the absence of additives, and with appropriate substrates, the coupling reactions are still successful although more sluggish,, and benzynes are proposed to play crucial roles in the initiation process in these cases.",H & L,889

E,Traveling wave-based protection scheme for inverter-dominated microgrid using mathematical morphology,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/traveling-wave-based-protection-scheme-for-inverter-dominated-mic,"Inverter-dominated microgrids impose significant challenges on the distribution network, as inverters are well known for their limited contribution to fault current, undermining the performance of traditional overcurrent protection schemes. This paper introduces a new protection scheme based on the initial current traveling wave utilizing an improved mathematical morphology (MM) technology, with simplified polarity detection and new logics introduced for meshed networks and feeders with single-end measurement. The proposed protection scheme provides ultrafast response and can be adapted to varied system operational modes, topologies, fault conditions, and load conditions. Only low-bandwidth communication is required to achieve high-speed operation and adequate discrimination level in meshed networks. Simulation in PSCAD/EMTDC verifies both the sensitivity and stability of the proposed protection scheme under different microgrid operational scenarios.",B & E,691

The presented models employ minimum software overhead within their electromagnetic transient parts to correctly represent modular multilevel converters (MMC) behaviour during dc network faults when converter switching devices are blocked. The validity and scalabilities of the presented models are demonstrated using open loop simulations of the half and full-bridge MMCs, and closed loop simulation of a full-scale HVDC link, with 201 cells per arm that equipped with basic HVDC controllers, including that for suppression of the 2nd harmonic currents in the converter arms. The results obtained from both demonstrations have shown that the presented models are able to accurately simulate the typical behaviour of the MMC during normal, and ac and dc network faults.",E & F,651

C,The NINJA-2 project: detecting and characterizing gravitational waveforms modelled using numerical binary black hole simulations,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-ninja-2-project-detecting-and-characterizing-gravitational-wa,"The Numerical INJection Analysis (NINJA) project is a collaborative effort between members of the numerical relativity and gravitational-wave (GW) astrophysics communities. The purpose of NINJA is to study the ability to detect GWs emitted from merging binary black holes (BBH) and recover their parameters with next-generation GW observatories. We report here on the results of the second NINJA project, NINJA-2, which employs 60 complete BBH hybrid waveforms consisting of a numerical portion modelling the late inspiral, merger, and ringdown stitched to a post-Newtonian portion modelling the early inspiral. In a 'blind injection challenge' similar to that conducted in recent Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo science runs, we added seven hybrid waveforms to two months of data recoloured to predictions of Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Advanced Virgo (AdV) sensitivity curves during their first observing runs. The resulting data was analysed by GW detection algorithms and 6 of the waveforms were recovered with false alarm rates smaller than 1 in a thousand years. Parameter-estimation algorithms were run on each of these waveforms to explore the ability to constrain the masses, component angular momenta and sky position of these waveforms. We find that the strong degeneracy between the mass ratio and the BHs' angular momenta will make it difficult to precisely estimate these parameters with aLIGO and AdV. We also perform a large-scale Monte Carlo study to assess the ability to recover each of the 60 hybrid waveforms with early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves. Our results predict that early aLIGO and AdV will have a volume-weighted average sensitive distance of 300 Mpc (1 Gpc) for 10M circle dot + 10M circle dot (50M circle dot + 50M circle dot) BBH coalescences. We demonstrate that neglecting the component angular momenta in the waveform models used in matched-filtering will result in a reduction in sensitivity for systems with large component angular momenta. This reduction is estimated to be up to similar to 15% for 50M circle dot + 50M circle dot BBH coalescences with almost maximal angular momenta aligned with the orbit when using early aLIGO and AdV sensitivity curves.",H & L,969
D,A critical account of a 'creeping neo-abolitionism': regulating prostitution in England and Wales,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-critical-account-of-a-creeping-neo-abolitionism-regulating-pros,"An increasingly dominant neo-abolitionist perspective on the issue of prostitution is currently taking hold across Europe. Pioneered in Sweden, this approach considers prostitution as inherently oppressive and seeks to tackle the dynamics of supply and demand by criminalizing purchasers and offering support to sellers who are regarded as victims. Against recent calls from both the European Parliament and an All Party Parliamentary Group on prostitution to universalize this model, we urge caution against moving any further in this direction. Our argument is informed, not only by critical accounts of the ‘Nordic model’, but also by emerging research which highlights the negative effects of recent criminal and ‘therapeutic’ interventions in England and Wales that have already attempted to reduce the demand and supply of commercial sex: the strict liability offence of paying for sexual services of a prostitute subject to exploitation and Engagement and Support Orders (ESOs) for on-street sex workers. We offer both normative insights and draw upon the findings of the first empirical study of ESOs, in order to highlight the problems that emerge when the complexities of commercial sexual exchange are reduced into a binary of ‘victims and victimizers’ to be saved or corrected by criminal justice sanctioned initiatives. In conclusion, we argue for a more productive use of the criminal law that complements rather than eclipses the wider social justice concerns in this arena.",D,408

We here show that an enantiopure product can be obtained from achiral starting materials in a single organic reaction. An essential characteristic of this reaction is that the chiral product precipitates from the solution, introducing a crystal-solution interface which functions as an asymmetric autocatalytic system that provides sufficient chiral amplification to reach an enantiopure end state. This approach not only provides more insight into the origin of life but also offers a pathway to acquire enantiopure compounds for industrial applications.",B & E,836
A,A novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-novel-framework-for-quantification-of-supply-chain-risks,"Supply chain risk management is an active area of research and there is a research gap of exploring established risk quantification techniques in other fields for application in the context of supply chain management. We have developed a novel framework for quantification of supply chain risks that integrates two techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief network can capture interdependency between risk factors and Game theory can assess risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders within a supply network. We introduce a new node termed 'Game theoretic risks' in Bayesian network that gets its qualitative and quantitative structure from the Game theory based analysis of the existing policies and partnerships within a supply network. We have applied our proposed risk modeling framework on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft. Two different Bayesian networks have been modeled; one representing the Boeing's perceived supply chain risks and the other depicting real time supply chain risks faced by the company. The qualitative structures of both the models were developed through cognitive maps that were constructed from the facts outlined in a case study. The quantitative parts were populated based on intuition and subsequently updated with the facts. The Bayesian network model incorporating quantification of game theoretic risks provides all the reasons for the delays and financial loss of the project. Furthermore, the proactive strategies identified in various case studies were verified through our model. Such an integrated application of two different quantification techniques in the realm of supply chain risk management bridges the mentioned research gap. Successful application of the framework justifies its potential for further testing in other supply chain risk quantification scenarios.",E & F,741

For such small Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) a short warning would be sufficient to have a protection plan in place on ground. However, small asteroids are difficult to be detected from ground, especially if they approach the Earth from the Sun direction, such as the Chelyabinsk object. For this reason, a multi-spacecraft mission was proposed to monitor PHAs from a telescope base orbiting on Distant Retrograde Orbits of the Sun – Earth system. This space-based system would allow increasing the warning time of asteroids incoming from the Sun

D,On square-wave-driven stochastic resonance for energy harvesting in a bistable system,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/on-square-wave-driven-stochastic-resonance-for-energy-harvesting-,"Stochastic resonance is a physical phenomenon through which the throughput of energy within an oscillator excited by a stochastic source can be boosted by adding a small modulating excitation. This study investigates the feasibility of implementing square-wave-driven stochastic resonance to enhance energy harvesting. The motivating hypothesis was that such stochastic resonance can be efficiently realized in a bistable mechanism. However, the condition for the occurrence of stochastic resonance is conventionally defined by the Kramers rate. This definition is inadequate because of the necessity and difficulty in estimating white noise density. A bistable mechanism has been designed using an explicit analytical model which implies a new approach for achieving stochastic resonance in the paper. Experimental tests confirm that the addition of a small-scale force to the bistable system excited by a random signal apparently leads to a corresponding amplification of the response that we now term square-wave-driven stochastic resonance. The study therefore indicates that this approach may be a promising way to improve the performance of an energy harvester under certain forms of random excitation.",H & L,124
B,Formation of stable uranium(VI) colloidal nanoparticles in conditions relevant to radioactive waste disposal,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/formation-of-stable-uraniumvi-colloidal-nanoparticles-in-conditio,"The favored pathway for disposal of higher activity radioactive wastes is via deep geological disposal. Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of groundwater with the cement and waste will form a plume of a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10-13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, a key component of many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4.2-252 μM U(VI). The results show that in cement leachates with 42 μM U(VI), colloids formed within hours and remained stable for several years. The colloids consisted of 1.5-1.8 nm nanoparticles with a proportion forming 20-60 nm aggregates. Using XAS and electron microscopy, we were able to determine that the colloidal nanoparticles had a clarkeite (sodium-uranate)-type crystallographic structure. The presented results have clear and hitherto unrecognized implications for the mobility of U(VI) in cementitious environments, in particular those associated with the geological disposal of nuclear waste.

Second, policy and practitioner organisations played a key role in our series, thereby adding a more practical element to discussions. An overarching concern emerging from the seminar series was the nature of the language we use when discussing those experiencing vulnerability, and how this language impacts on the relationship s between individuals and the services they used (both private and non - commercial). In particular, this presentation will consider the issues involved when approaching vulnerability with consumer - focused terminology.",C,338
E,Choosing international organizations: when do states and the World Bank collaborate on environmental projects?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/choosing-international-organizations-when-do-states-and-the-world,"While international cooperation research emphasizes institutional design, states mostly interact with existing organizations. How do states choose organizations for cooperation? We develop a theory of agency choice for development projects, emphasizing the importance of domestic institutions, the scope of cooperation, and the resources of the implementing agency. If states are to cooperate with funding agencies that have abundant resources, such as the World Bank, they must accept more stringent conditions on project implementation. We argue states accept the stringent conditions that resourceful organizations demand if the public goods from project implementation are highly valuable. Empirically, this is the case for democratic states, large projects, and projects that produce national instead of global public goods. We test this theory using data on 2,882 Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects, 1991–2011. The GEF offers an ideal case because various implementing agencies are responsible for the actual projects. States implement projects in collaboration with the World Bank, which has the most expertise and resources among the GEF’s implementing agencies, if their regime type is democracy, the project size is large, and the benefits are primarily national. Qualitative evidence sheds light on causal mechanisms.",B & E,205
D,Cross-infection effect of polymers of historic and heritage significance on the degradation of a cellulose reference test material,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cross-infection-effect-of-polymers-of-historic-and-heritage-signi,"The cross-infection effect of 105 polymer samples was studied, using cellulose as a reference test material. In total 14 polymer types were studied, comprising “modern materials” commonly found in historic and artistic collections including: cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose nitrate (CN), poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC),  polyurethane (PUR) and a selection of specialised packaging materials used in art and heritage conservation. Polymer samples were placed in glass vials containing a piece of the cellulose reference and vials were sealed before being heated to 80 C for 14 days. The cross-infection effect on the reference cellulose was measured using viscometry to calculate the degree of polymerisation relative to that of a control reference and a classification system of the cross-infection or preservation effect is proposed. Solid phase micro-extraction (SPME)-GC/MS was used to detect and identify the emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from a select number of polymer samples. CN was identified as the polymer with the most severe cross-infection effect while others e.g. polycarbonate (PC) had no effect or even a beneficial effect. Acetic acid was found to be the most characteristic emission detected from the most severely cross-infecting materials.",E & F,442
B,Outlook and appraisal [March 2014],https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/outlook-and-appraisal-march-2014,"The latest Scottish GDP data for the third quarter of 2013 show that Scottish GDP rose by 0.7% in Scotland in the quarter, a little less than the 0.8% rise in the UK.  Over the year to the second quarter - four quarters on previous four quarters - Scottish GDP grew at 1.3% identical to the outturn in the UK. These data provide further evidence of a strengthening recovery. Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the previous 6 quarters. Yet, as noted in the previous Commentary the recovery continues to be considerably weaker than from any recession in the last 70 to 80 years.",F & K,811

Due to the particularity of the latter, a discretization of a more sophisticated Schwarz method is not straightforward. A strategy of discretization is shown in the framework of a DG weak formulation, and the equivalence between multi-domain and single-domain solutions is proved. The proposed discrete framework is then illustrated by some numerical results through the simulation of two-dimensional propagation problems.",M & I,134
E,A CFD study on two-phase frozen flow of air/water through a safety relief valve,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-cfd-study-on-two-phase-frozen-flow-of-airwater-through-a-safety,"The air-water two phase critical flows through a safety relief valve commonly used in the refrigeration industry is examined with particular emphasis on the prediction of the critical mass flowrates using CFD based approaches. The expansion of the gas through the valve and the associated acceleration is coupled to the liquid phase and results in changes to the velocity slip with the possibility of influencing the choking conditions and the magnitude of the critical mass flows. These conditions are poorly reported in the literature for safety valves. This paper presents a study where the ability of established two phase multi-dimensional modelling approaches to predict such conditions are investigated. Comparison with the simplified mixture model will show that this model tends to underestimate mass flowrates for medium to high liquid mass fraction. However, the two fluid model can adequately account for the thermal and mechanical non equilibrium for these complex flow conditions with the use of simplified droplet sizing rules.",B & L,826
A,An advanced CFD model to study the effect of non-condensable gas on cavitation in positive displacement pumps,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-advanced-cfd-model-to-study-the-effect-of-non-condensable-gas-,An advanced transient CFD model of a positive displacement reciprocating pump was created to study its behavior and performance in cavitating conditions throughout the inlet stroke. The “full” cavitation model developed by Singhal et al. was utilized and a sensitivity analysis test on two amounts (1.5 and 15 parts per million) air mass fraction content was carried out to study the influence of the air content in water on the cavitation phenomenon. The model was equipped with user defined functions to introduce the liquid compressibility which stabilizes the simulation and to handle the two-way coupling between the pressure field and the inlet valve lift history. Estimation of the pump performance is also presented in both cases.,E & A,759
B,Comparisons among the five ground-motion models developed using RESORCE for the prediction of response spectral accelerations due to earthquakes in Europe and the Middle East,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/comparisons-among-the-five-ground-motion-models-developed-using-r,"This article presents comparisons among the five ground-motion models described in other articles within this special issue, in terms of data selection criteria, characteristics of the models and predicted peak ground and response spectral accelerations. Comparisons are also made with predictions from the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) models to which the models presented here have similarities (e.g. a common master database has been used) but also differences (e.g. some models in this issue are nonparametric). As a result of the differing data selection criteria and derivation techniques the predicted median ground motions show considerable differences (up to a factor of two for certain scenarios), particularly for magnitudes and distances close to or beyond the range of the available observations. The predicted influence of style-of-faulting shows much variation among models whereas site amplification factors are more similar, with peak amplification at around 1s. These differences are greater than those among predictions from the NGA models. The models for aleatory variability (sigma), however, are similar and suggest that ground-motion variability from this region is slightly higher than that predicted by the NGA models, based primarily on data from California and Taiwan.",A & G,160
C,Nanosecond colloidal quantum dot lasers for sensing,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/nanosecond-colloidal-quantum-dot-lasers-for-sensing,"Low-threshold, gain switched colloidal quantum dot (CQD) distributed-feedback lasers operating in the nanosecond regime are reported and proposed for sensing applications for the first time to the authors’ knowledge. The lasers are based on a mechanically-flexible polymeric, second order grating structure overcoated with a thin-film of CQD/PMMA composite. The threshold fluence of the resulting lasers is as low as 0.5 mJ/cm2 for a 610 nm emission and the typical linewidth is below 0.3 nm. The emission wavelength of the lasers can be set at the design stage and laser operation between 605 nm and 616 nm, while using the exact same CQD gain material, is shown. In addition, the potential of such CQD lasers for refractive index sensing in solution is demonstrated by immersion in water.",H & L,870
D,Investigation of the ultrafast dynamics occurring during unsensitized photocatalytic H2 evolution by an [FeFe]-hydrogenase subsite analogue,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/investigation-of-the-ultrafast-dynamics-occurring-during-unsensit,"Biomimetic compounds based upon the active subsite of the [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme system have been the focus of much attention as catalysts for hydrogen production: a clean energy vector. Until recently, use of hydrogenase subsite systems for light-driven hydrogen production has typically required the involvement of a photosensitizer, but the molecule [(μ-pdt)(μ-H)Fe2(CO)4(dppv)]+, (1; dppv = cis-1,2-C2H2(PPh2)2; pdt = 1,3-propanedithiolate) has been reported to catalyze the evolution of hydrogen gas under sensitizer-free conditions. Establishing the molecular mechanism that leads to photohydrogen production by 1 is thus an important step that may enable further development of this family of molecules as solar fuel platforms. Here, we report ultrafast UVpump–IRprobe spectroscopy of 1 at three different excitation wavelengths and in a range of solvents, including under the conditions required for H2 production. Combining spectroscopic measurements of the photochemistry and vibrational relaxation dynamics of 1 with ground-state density functional theory (DFT) calculations shows that, irrespective of experimental conditions, near-instantaneous carbonyl ligand loss is the main photochemical channel. No evidence for a long-lived excited electronic state was found. These results provide the first time-resolved data for the photochemistry of 1 and offer an alternative interpretation of the underlying mechanism of light-driven hydrogen generation.",D,116
A,Enhanced up-conversion for photovoltaics via concentrating integrated optics,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/enhanced-up-conversion-for-photovoltaics-via-concentrating-integr,"Concentrating optics are integrated into up-conversion photovoltaic (UC-PV) devices to independently concentrate sub-band-gap photons on the up-conversion layer, without affecting the full solar concentration on the overlying solar cell. The UC-PV devices consist of silicon solar cells optimized for up-conversion, coupled with tapered and parabolic dielectric concentrators, and hexagonal sodium yttrium fluoride (β-NaYF4) up-converter doped with 25% trivalent erbium (Er3+). A normalized external quantum efficiency of 1.75x10-2 cm2/W and 3.38x10-2 cm2/W was obtained for the UC-PV device utilizing tapered and parabolic concentrators respectively. Although low to moderate concentration was shown to maximize UC, higher concentration lead to saturation and reduced external quantum efficiency. The presented work highlights some of the implications associated with the development of UC-PV devices and designates a substantial step for integration in concentrating PV.",C,358

A,Developing a universal reading comprehension intervention for mainstream primary schools within areas of social deprivation for children with and without language-learning impairment: a feasibility study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/developing-a-universal-reading-comprehension-intervention-for-mai,"Some children in areas of social deprivation in Scotland have lower reading attainments than neighbouring children in less deprived areas, and also lower spoken language comprehension skills than expected by assessment norms. There is a need to develop effective reading comprehension interventions that fit easily into the school curriculum that can benefit all pupils. A feasibility study of reading comprehension strategies with good evidence of efficacy was undertaken in three mainstream primary schools in an area of social deprivation in west central Scotland, to decide whether further investigation of this intervention was warranted.
Aims were to measure comprehension of spoken language and reading via standardised assessments towards the beginning of the school year (T1) in mainstream primary school classrooms within an area of social deprivation; to have teachers introduce previously-validated text comprehension strategies, and to measure change in reading comprehension outcome measures towards the end of the year (T2). 
A pre- and post-intervention cohort design was used. Reading comprehension strategies were introduced to staff in participating schools and used throughout the school year as part of on-going reading instruction. Spoken language comprehension was measured by TROG-2 at T1, and reading progress by score changes T1-T2 on the WIAT-IIUK-T reading comprehension scale. 
Forty-seven pupils in five classes in three primary schools took part: 38% had TROG-2 scores below the 10th centile. As a group, children made good reading comprehension progress, with a medium standardised effect size of 0.46. Children with TROG-2 scores below 10%ile had lower mean reading scores than others at T1 and T2, although with considerable overlap. However, TROG-2 did not make a unique contribution to reading progress: children below 10%ile made as much progress as other children. The outcomes suggest this intervention warrants further investigation in larger, controlled, studies.",E & F,347
B,Frequency-dependent ultrasound-induced transformation in E. coli,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/frequency-dependent-ultrasound-induced-transformation-in-e-coli,"Ultrasound-enhanced gene transfer (UEGT) is continuing to gain interest across many disciplines; however, very few studies investigate UEGT efficiency across a range of frequencies. Using a variable frequency generator, UEGT was tested in E. coli at six ultrasonic frequencies. Results indicate frequency can significantly influence UEGT efficiency positively and negatively. A frequency of 61 kHz improved UEGT efficiency by ~70 % higher, but 99 kHz impeded UEGT to an extent worse than no ultrasound exposure. The other four frequencies (26, 133, 174, and 190 kHz) enhanced transformation compared to no ultrasound, but efficiencies did not vary. The influence of frequency on UEGT efficiency was observed across a range of operating frequencies. It is plausible that frequency-dependent dynamics of mechanical and chemical energies released during cavitational-bubble collapse (CBC) are responsible for observed UEGT efficiencies.",F & K,411
B,Enforcement of Employment Tribunal Awards,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/enforcement-of-employment-tribunal-awards,"This report examines the experiences of Employment Tribunal (ET) claimants after an ET award was made in their favour. A workers’ success in the ET is by no means the end of the story when it comes to achieving justice for a wrongdoing against them in the workplace. Enforcing an award made by an ET can itself be highly problematic . 1 The data presented in this report were collected as part of a European Research Council funded project entitled Citizens Advice Bureaux and Employment Disputes . 2 The overall aim of this project was to understand workers’ experiences as they attempted to resolve problems faced at work, including identifying potential barriers to justice. Our particular focus was on workers who could not easily afford the services of a solicitor. As such, participants were recruited through Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) who are a key provider of employment advice to this group. We tracked the experiences of workers as they sought to resolve their workplace disputes – from their initial advice sessions with CABx to the closure ( or in some cases abandonment ) of the problem. The vast majority of our participants who pursued their claims in the ET did so prior to the introduction of fees on 29 July 2013. The report focuses on the paths taken and overall outcomes for participants who were successful with their claim in the ET. It begins by providing a brief overview of the system for enforcing ET awards. The key findings from our participant group are then presented in three sections : firstly, a summary of the outcomes of our participants; secondly, experiences of those who took formal action to enforce their ET awards; and, thirdly, experiences of those who did not take formal action to enforce their ET awards. Finally, detailed vignettes elaborating on and contextualising these findings in relation to specific individuals are presented.",M & I,291
D,Effectiveness of GNSS disposal strategies,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effectiveness-of-gnss-disposal-strategies,"The management of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and of the Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) region as a whole is a subject that cannot be deferred, due to the growing exploitation and launch rate in that orbital regime. The advent of the European Galileo and the Chinese Beidou constellations significantly added complexity to the system and calls for an adequate global view on the four constellations present in operation. The operation procedures, including maintenance and disposal practices, of the constellations currently deployed were analyzed in order to asses a proper reference simulation scenario. The complex dynamics of the MEO region with all the geopotential and lunisolar resonances was studied to better identify the proper end-of-life orbit for every proposed strategy, taking into account and, whenever possible, exploiting the orbital dynamics in this peculiar region of space. The possibility to exploit low thrust propulsion or non gravitational perturbations with passive de-orbiting devices (and a combination of the two) was analyzed, in view of possible applications in the design of the future generations of the constellations satellites. Several upgrades in the long-term evolution software SDM and DAMAGE were undertaken to properly handle the constellation simulations in every aspect from constellation maintenance to orbital dynamics.  A thorough approach considering the fulltime evolving covariance matrix associated with every object was implemented in SDM to compute the collision risk and associated maneuver rate for the constellation satellites. Once the software upgrades will be completed, the effectiveness of the different disposal strategies will be analyzed in terms of residual collision risk and avoidance maneuvers rate.",B & L,870
C,Formation of helices in graphene nanoribbons under torsion,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/formation-of-helices-in-graphene-nanoribbons-under-torsion,"We use objective boundary conditions and self-consistent charge density-functional-based tight-binding to simulate at the atomistic scale the formation of helices in narrow graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges terminated with fluorine and hydrogen.  We interpret the microscopic data using an inextensible, unshearable elastic rod model, which considers both bending and torsional strains. When fitted to the atomistic data, the  simple rod model uses closed-form solutions for a cubic equation to predict the strain energy and morphology at a given twist angle and the crossover point between pure torsion and a helix. Our modeling and simulation bring key insights into the origin of the helical graphene morphologies stored inside of carbon nanotubes. They can be useful for designing chiral nanoribbons with tailored properties.",E & A,416
A,A support tool for assessing the risks of heavy lift vessel logistics in the installation of offshore wind farms,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-support-tool-for-assessing-the-risks-of-heavy-lift-vessel-logis,Semi-submersible heavy lift vessels (HLVs) are currently the main option for the installation of electrical substation platforms on offshore wind farms.  As sites move further offshore installation operations are subject to harsher weather conditions which results in increased uncertainty over the cost and duration of the installation. Assessing the comparative risks associated with logistical decisions and identifying the best course of action is therefore a challenging problem. This study describes a support tool developed through collaboration between industry and academia which is designed to aid decision makers by providing improved understanding of the risks associated with logistical decisions. A case study of a realistic offshore wind farm installation is utilised to explore the impact of key HLV logistical decisions on the cost and duration of the installation of offshore substations.,A & G,118
D,A review and analysis of renewable energy curtailment schemes and Principles of Access: transitioning towards business as usual,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-review-and-analysis-of-renewable-energy-curtailment-schemes-and,"Abstract In the last decade, the EU has driven forward the development and connection of renewable power sources across Europe. This has changed the way in which distribution networks operate, moving from a passive system, to a more active system where generation and demand are located closer together with system states being more complex and variable. Increased penetration of renewable generation into distribution networks is presenting a number of challenges to Distribution Network Operators (DNOs) including the provision of network access in capacity constrained networks. The introduction of Active Network Management (ANM) is enabling an increase in renewable generation connections through enhanced network access in otherwise ‘full’ networks. This paper presents a way in which DNOs might move towards Business as Usual (BAU) arrangements for ANM schemes. It is necessary to determine the curtailment arrangements, or Principles of Access (PoA), and from this estimate generation access under ANM and the flow of services and money for different scenarios. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review, detailed case study evaluation on early ANM schemes, quantitative curtailment assessment for different PoA and a qualitative analysis of business models for different ANM PoA is presented in turn with conclusions drawn from these three approaches.",H & L,416
B,Effects of target pre-heating and expansion on terahertz radiation production from intense laser-solid interactions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effects-of-target-pre-heating-and-expansion-on-terahertz-radiatio,"The first experimental measurements of intense (∼7×1019 W cm−2) laser-driven terahertz (THz) radiation from a solid target which is preheated by an intense pulse of laser-accelerated protons is reported. The total energy of the THz radiation is found to decrease by approximately a factor of 2 compared to a cold target reference. This is attributed to an increase in the scale length of the preformed plasma, driven by proton heating, at the front surface of the target, where the THz radiation is generated. The results show the importance of controlling the preplasma scale length for THz production.",D,243

D,A new radiation condition for ships travelling with very low forward speed,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-new-radiation-condition-for-ships-travelling-with-very-low-forw,"The 3-D Rankine source method is becoming a very popular method for the seakeeping problem, especially when marine vessels are travelling with forward speed. However, this method requires an accurate radiation condition to ensure that the waves propagate away from the ship. Considerable effort has been expanded for the accurate formulation of the radiation condition when a ship travels at the moderate to high speed range, and significant progress has been made in the last few decades when the Brard number τ is greater than 0.25. But for the very low forward speed problem (τ<0.25), the ordinary radiation condition will not be valid since the scattered waves will propagate ahead of the vessel. The primary purpose of the present study which is to be presented in this paper is to investigate the formulation of a new radiation condition which can account for the very low forward speed problem. To verify this new radiation condition, a Wigley III hull has been modelled by using the 3-D panel method. The hydrodynamic coefficients and the wave pattern of the vessel at zero speed and travelling with very low and medium forward speeds are calculated separately. From the comparisons of the present results with experimental measurements, it can be concluded that the new radiation condition can accurately predict the hydrodynamic properties of vessels travelling with low to medium forward speed or stationary in waves.",E & F,915

The formulation of the problem is based on a Boundary Integral Equation for the associated velocity potential combined with the null-pressure jump Kutta condition at the trailing edge. The developed Isogeometric-BEM is based on a parametric NURBS representation of the hydrofoil and employs the very same basis for representing the velocity potential. The Boundary Integral Equation is numerically solved by collocating at the Greville abscissas of the knot vector of the hydrofoil's parametric representation. Numerical error analysis of the Isogeometric-BEM using h-renement is performed and compared with classical low-order panel methods.",F & K,489

This has arguably led to findings that trade the contextualization of entrepreneurial processes for abstracted theoretical generalizations. We propose a methodological response that draws on ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to form the theoretical basis of a more nuanced empirical conception of the entrepreneur in situ. Our approach addresses current epistemological concerns in entrepreneurship scholarship by prioritizing the practical knowledge and reasoning skills of the entrepreneur. Additionally the proposed methodology provides a solution to an analytical problem confronting scholars who must select from myriad potentially relevant contexts to incorporate into analysis. We conclude our article by identifying some research opportunities that are enabled through adoption of an ethnomethodology/conversation analysis perspective. We hope that scholars may expand upon, complement and challenge current conceptualizations of entrepreneurial behavior through this method.",B & L,369
A,Aerothermodynamic comparison of two- and three-dimensional rarefied hypersonic cavity flows,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/aerothermodynamic-comparison-of-two-and-three-dimensional-rarefie,"The thermal protection system is a key element in atmospheric re-entry missions of aerospace vehicles. Usually, in the thermal load calculations, the analysis assumes that the vehicle has a smooth surface. However, discontinuities or imperfections are often present on the aerospace vehicle surfaces due to fabrication tolerances, sensor installations, spaces between the thermal protection plates, and differential expansion or ablation rates between non-similar materials. In the present work, rarefied hypersonic flows over two- and three-dimensional cavities at an altitude of 80km in the Earth’s atmosphere are studied numerically. To model flows in the transitional regime, where the validity of the Navier Stokes equations is questionable, the direct simulation Monte Carlo method has been used. The primary goal is to assess the sensitivity of heat transfer, pressure, and skin-friction coefficients for a family of two- and three-dimensional cavities defined by different length-to-depth ratios. The analysis shows that an assumption of two-dimensionality plays a key role in the over prediction of the aerodynamic properties. Previous work using a continuum approach shows that two recirculation regions and flow attachment occurs when the length-to-depth ratio is equal to 14; however, the same phenomena are observed in the transitional regime when the cavity length-to-depth ratio is equal to 4.  A study of the influence of the cavity width has also been conducted. It is shown that increasing the cavity width results in an augmentation of the surface aerothermodynamic quantities",E & A,377

This, and possibly a cluster of other earthquakes, can be derived from archaeological data. These earthquakes are not included in the historical seismicity catalogues, but can be used to put constraints to the seismic risk of this city. Patras was affected by a cluster of poorly documented earthquakes between 1714 and 1806. The city seems to be exposed to risks of progressive reactivation of a major strike-slip fault. A magnitude 6.4 earthquake in 2008 has been related to it.

In this study, we used conversation analysis to examine the compassionate self-soothing task of emotion-focused therapy involving two-chair work, with seven clients. The analysis yielded a detailed description of interactional practices and processes involved in the accomplishment of self-soothing, drawing on Goffman’s concept of the participation frame. In this article we show how therapists and clients collaborate to move from the ordinary frame of therapeutic conversation to a self-soothing frame and back again. Furthermore, we show that in this movement between the frames, they make use of a number interactional practices: therapists'  instructions to clients, specific ways of sequencing actions in interaction, explanations and justification of the importance of the self-soothing task, pronouns as a way to distinguish among addressees (e.g., clients versus soothing agents), corrections of clients’ talk, and response tokens (hm mm, yeah, good). These practices are used to help clients accomplish self-soothing in the form of self-praise, disclosing caring, and offering of helpful advice.",H & L,693
D,Anomaly detection techniques for the condition monitoring of tidal turbines,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/anomaly-detection-techniques-for-the-condition-monitoring-of-tida,"Harnessing the power of currents from the sea bed, tidal power has great potential to provide a means of renewable energy generation more predictable than similar technologies such as wind power. However, the nature of the operating environment provides challenges, with maintenance requiring a lift operation to gain access to the turbine above water. Failures of system components can therefore result in prolonged periods of downtime while repairs are completed on the surface, removing the system’s ability to produce electricity and damaging revenues. The utilization of effective condition monitoring systems can therefore prove particularly beneficial to this industry.

This paper explores the use of the CRISP-DM data mining process model for identifying key trends within turbine sensor data, to define the expected response of a tidal turbine. Condition data from an operational 1 MW turbine, installed off the coast of Orkney, Scotland, was used for this study. The effectiveness of modeling techniques, including curve fitting, Gaussian mixture modeling, and density estimation are explored, using tidal turbine data in the absence of faults. The paper shows how these models can be used for anomaly detection of live turbine data, with anomalies indicating the possible onset of a fault within the

This paper explores the initial findings of an evaluation report conducted by a university research team, exploring the creative performances designed by Starcatchers, an organisation developing performing arts experiences for children aged birth to 4 years. The research team consisted of four action researchers who were each attached to an artist in residence working in four theatre venues across Scotland. The artists involved represented four different art domains: puppetry, visual arts, artistic experiences informed by play therapy and installation work. The researchers collaborated with the artists to observe children’s engagement, provide feedback, discuss projects, and record the processes of project development. This paper seeks to explore the artists' experience of designing and implementing participative performance events and the nature and processes of working with young children in performing arts.
It focuses on an exploration of the creative learning processes which were developed by the artists in residence to promote children's creativity and involvement in the visual arts. The role of the artist is examined and key aspects are suggested with a view to enhancing the creative learning experiences provided for children within educational contexts, indicating points for consideration by adults charged with the responsibility of planning and developing environments which support young children's creativity.",C,859
E,Enhanced proton beam collimation in the ultra-intense short pulse regime,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/enhanced-proton-beam-collimation-in-the-ultra-intense-short-pulse,"The collimation of proton beams accelerated during ultra-intense laser irradiation of thin aluminum foils was measured experimentally whilst varying laser contrast. Increasing the laser contrast using a double plasma mirror system resulted in a marked decrease in proton beam divergence (20° to <10°), and the enhanced collimation persisted over a wide range of target thicknesses (50 nm–6 µm), with an increased flux towards thinner targets. Supported by numerical simulation, the larger beam divergence at low contrast is attributed to the presence of a significant plasma scale length on the target front surface. This alters the fast electron generation and injection into the target, affecting the resultant sheath distribution and dynamics at the rear target surface. This result demonstrates that careful control of the laser contrast will be important for future laser-driven ion applications in which control of beam divergence is crucial.",B & E,413
A,Simulations of a FIR oscillator with large slippage parameter at jefferson lab for FIR/UV pump-probe experiments,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/simulations-of-a-fir-oscillator-with-large-slippage-parameter-at-,"We previously proposed a dual FEL configuration on the UV Demo FEL at
Jefferson Lab that would allow simultaneous lasing at FIR and UV wavelengths [1]. The FIR source would be an FEL oscillator with a short wiggler providing diffraction-limited pulses with pulse energy exceeding 50 microJoules, using the exhaust beam from a UVFEL as the input electron beam. Since the UV FEL requires very short pulses, the input to the FIR FEL is extremely short compared to a slippage length and the usual Slowly Varying Envelope Approximation (SVEA) does not apply. We use a non-SVEA code [2] to simulate this system both with a small energy spread (UV laser off) and with large energy spread (UV laser on).",E & F,484
B,Examining fault behaviour of a superconducting DC network,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/examining-fault-behaviour-of-a-superconducting-dc-network,"A large body of research is currently being conducted into superconducting power system applications, targeting improved efficiency and reductions in system size and weight. In order to attain the required levels of safety and reliability of the superconducting power system, effective protection systems, tailored to the specific fault behaviour of the novel components must also be in place. This paper presents a review of relevant literature concerning the dynamic and transient characteristics of superconducting DC networks and key associated components (such as superconducting cables and machines). This first part of a two stage Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is presented, which provides a conceptual consideration of expected physical failure modes and mechanisms. The effects on the wider network are discussed from which various protection considerations are drawn. A number of key research questions are drawn from this study, which will form the starting point of the second stage of the FMEA. The outputs from the FMEA will shape the protection requirements for a superconducting DC network.",F & K,861

It identifies key legislation, policy and initiatives which have impacted on the protection and safeguarding of children in care.  For many developments and initiatives, however, it is difficult to gauge the direct impact on practice and on the outcomes and experiences of children and young people in care.  This overview has also identified a range of other evidence which indicates that services are not fulfilling the needs of children and young people. Despite all the safeguards, children and young people in care continue to suffer abuse and neglect which underlines the importance of constant scrutiny of policy and practice.",M & I,640
D,"Quantumness of correlations, quantumness of ensembles and quantum data hiding",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantumness-of-correlations-quantumness-of-ensembles-and-quantum-,"We study the quantumness of correlations for ensembles of bi- and multi-partite systems and relate it to the task of quantum data hiding. Quantumness is here intended in the sense of minimum average disturbance under local measurements. We consider a very general framework, but focus on local complete von Neumann measurements as cause of the disturbance, and, later on, on the trace-distance as quantifier of the disturbance.  We discuss connections with entanglement and previously defined notions of quantumness of correlations. We prove that a large class of quantifiers of the quantumness of correlations are entanglement monotones for pure bipartite states. In particular, we define an entanglement of disturbance for pure states, for which we give an analytical expression. Such a measure coincides with negativity and concurrence for the case of two qubits. We compute general bounds on disturbance for both single states and ensembles, and consider several examples, including the uniform Haar ensemble of pure states, and pairs of qubit states. Finally, we show that the notion of ensemble quantumness of correlations is most relevant in quantum data hiding. Indeed, while it is known that entanglement is not  necessary for a good quantum data hiding scheme, we prove that ensemble quantumness of correlations is.",B & L,262

Distortions in the spatial profile of the output laser beam are analyzed. The thermal lens is astigmatic; the orientation of its principal meridional planes, A and B, is determined by the anisotropy of photo-elastic effect. The thermal lens has opposite signs for rays lying in the principal meridional planes for Np- and O-cut crystals; it is positive for an Ng-cut crystal. The increase of thermal lens optical power after absorption of 1 W of pump power, i.e. the thermal lens sensitivity factors MA(B), and astigmatism degree S = |MA–MB| are determined. The photo-elastic effect was found to increase the optical power of the thermal lens and was significant for all studied crystal orientations.",A & G,700
D,Assessing wind farm reliability using weather dependent failure rates,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/assessing-wind-farm-reliability-using-weather-dependent-failure-r,"Using reliability data comprising of two modern, large scale wind farm sites and wind data from two onsite met masts, a model is developed which calculates wind speed dependant failure rates which are used to populate a Markov Chain. Monte Carlo simulation is then exercised to simulate three wind farms which are subjected to controlled wind speed conditions from three separate potential UK sites. The model then calculates and compares wind farm reliability due to corrective maintenance and component failure rates influenced by the wind speed of each of the sites. Results show that the components affected most by changes in average daily wind speed are the control system and the yaw system. A comparison between this model and a more simple estimation of site yield is undertaken. The model takes into account the effects of the wind speed on the cost of operation and maintenance and also includes the impact of longer periods of downtime in the winter months and shorter periods in the summer. By taking these factors into account a more detailed site assessment can be undertaken. There is significant value to this model for operators and manufacturers.",H & L,664

C,Exploring accounting-sustainability hybridisation in the UK public sector,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/exploring-accounting-sustainability-hybridisation-in-the-uk-publi,"The transformative potential of accounting-sustainability hybrids has been promoted and problematized in the literature. We contribute to this debate by exploring, theoretically and empirically, the role of accounting in shaping and reshaping sustainability practices.
We develop a holistic framework which we use to analyse the governing and mediating roles of accounting-sustainability hybrids in the Environment Agency (of England and Wales) and West Sussex County Council. Our analysis identifies that local accounting-sustainability hybrids contribute positively to improving eco-efficiency, have some impact on eco-effectiveness, but limited bearing on social justice. Emerging assemblages of accounting-sustainability hybrids create capacity for wider sustainability transformations, particularly through their mediating roles. However, a number of factors combine to frustrate further sustainability transformations within these organisations and those they are charged with governing. These factors include the structural constraints of the accounting-sustainability hybrids, influenced by a relatively weak local sustainability programmatic and the pressing need to meet increasing service delivery expectations in a period of severe resource constraints.",C,231
E,Attitudes towards school choice and faith schools in the UK: a question of individual preference or collective interest?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/attitudes-towards-school-choice-and-faith-schools-in-the-uk-a-que,"As has been the case in a number of countries, parents in England have increasingly been given the opportunity to choose between different types of schools. Doing so is regarded as a way of meeting individual needs and improving academic standards. Faith-based schools long predate this move towards a more diversified educational system, but have come to be regarded as one of the ways of fulfilling the recent agenda. Drawing on social identity theory, we suggest that attitudes towards faith-based schools reflect social (religious) identities and group interests associated with those identities rather than beliefs about the merits of individual choice. We demonstrate this is the case using data from all four parts of the UK. However, the extent to which attitudes towards faith-based schools are a reflection of religious identities varies across the four parts in line with the structure of the religious economy and educational provision locally. We conclude that rather than reflecting a supposedly a-social concern with choice, support for diversity of educational provision may be rooted instead in collective – and potentially antagonistic - social identities.",B & E,180

The current paper corrects an error in our original figures but also compares the estimates of The Changing Body with those published by a range of other authors. The differences reflect disagreements over a number of issues, including the amount of land under cultivation, the extraction and wastage rates for cereals and pulses and the number of animals supplying meat and dairy products.  The paper considers recent attempts to achieve a compromise between these estimates and challenges claims that there was a dramatic reduction in either food availability or the average height of birth cohorts in the late-eighteenth century.",F & K,574
C,An adaptive spatio-temporal smoothing model for estimating trends and step changes in disease risk,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-adaptive-spatio-temporal-smoothing-model-for-estimating-trends,"Statistical models used to estimate the spatio-temporal pattern in disease risk from areal unit data often represent the risk surface for each time period in terms of known covariates and a set of spatially smooth random effects. The latter act as a proxy for unmeasured spatial confounding, whose spatial structure is often characterised by a spatially smooth evolution between some pairs of adjacent areal units while other pairs exhibit large step changes. This spatial heterogeneity is not consistent with a global smoothing model in which partial correlation exists between all pairs of adjacent spatial random effects, and a novel space-time disease model with an adaptive spatial smoothing specification that can identify step changes is therefore proposed. The new model is motivated by a new study of respiratory and circulatory disease risk across the set of Local Authorities in England, and is rigorously tested by simulation to assess its efficacy. Results from the England study show that the two diseases have similar spatial patterns in risk, and exhibit a number of common step changes in the unmeasured component of risk between neighbouring local authorities.",M & I,252
E,High order harmonics from relativistic electron spikes,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/high-order-harmonics-from-relativistic-electron-spikes,"A new regime of relativistic high-order harmonic generation is discovered [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 135004 (2012)]. Multi-terawatt relativistic-irradiance (>1018 W/cm2) femtosecond (~30-50 fs) lasers focused to underdense (few×1019 cm-3) plasma formed in gas jet targets produce comb-like spectra with hundreds of even and odd harmonic orders reaching the photon energy of 360 eV, including the 'water window' spectral range. Harmonics are generated by either linearly or circularly polarized pulses from the J-KAREN (KPSI, JAEA) and Astra Gemini (CLF, RAL, UK) lasers. The photon number scalability has been demonstrated with a 120 TW laser producing 40 μJ/sr per harmonic at 120 eV. The experimental results are explained using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and catastrophe theory. A new mechanism of harmonic generation by sharp, structurally stable, oscillating electron spikes at the joint of boundaries of wake and bow waves excited by a laser pulse is introduced.

B,Energy storage system sizing For peak hour utility applications in smart grid,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/energy-storage-system-sizing-for-peak-hour-utility-applications-i,"Energy Storage Systems (ESS) are expected to play a critical role in future energy grids. ESS technologies are primarily employed for reducing the stress on grid and the use of hydrocarbons for electricity generation. However, in order for ESS option to become economically viable, proper sizing is highly desired to recover the high capital cost. In this paper we propose a system architecture that enables us to optimally size the ESS system according to the number of users. We model the demand of each customer by a two-state Markovian fluid and the aggregate demand of all users are multiplexed at the ESS. The proposed model also draws a constant power from the grid and it is used to accommodate the customer demand and charge the storage unit, if required. Then, given the population of customers and their stochastic demands, and the power drawn from the grid we provide an analytical solution for ESS sizing using the underflow probability as the main performance metric, which is defined as the percentage of time that the system resources fall short of demand. Such insights very important in designing the system planning phases of future energy grid infrastructures.",A & G,820
C,Improved fault location through analysis of system parameters during auto-reclose operations on transmission lines,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/improved-fault-location-through-analysis-of-system-parameters-dur,"This paper describes a novel single-ended impedance-based fault-location method for transmission lines, which is based upon the analysis of voltage and current during discrete system states that arise during the operation of single- and three-phase autoreclose schemes. A fault-location estimation algorithm, using the data measured during various system states and is capable of locating the fault types involving one fault resistance (i.e., single-line-to-ground fault or line-to-line fault), is developed and presented. The proposed fault-location technique is shown to have high accuracy; results are presented and compared with the well-established Takagi method and the performance of the algorithm is analyzed and discussed. The proposed technique can reduce or negate limitations associated with conventional single-ended methods and can also estimate other factors associated with the fault (e.g., fault resistance and remote source impedance). In addition, it is a potentially economic solution, since it is relatively straightforward to implement on a standard protection relay hardware platform. The proposed method is demonstrated using Electromagnetic Transients Program/Alternate Transients Program simulation models for a variety of different cases. This paper concludes with an overview of ongoing and future work that has the intention of moving the work forward toward implementation within commercially available relay hardware.",H & L,418

An expression is introduced for the proton acceleration time, which takes account of the time taken for the laser-accelerated electrons, which expand laterally at the rear surface of the target, to escape the region of the sheath. When incorporated into an analytical model of plasma expansion, this approach is found to provide a good fit to measured scaling of the maximum proton energy as a function of intensity at large focal spot sizes.",D,764
A,Model switching and model averaging in time-varying parameter regression models,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/model-switching-and-model-averaging-in-time-varying-parameter-reg,"This paper investigates the usefulness of switching Gaussian state space models as a tool for implementing dynamic model selection (DMS) or averaging (DMA) in time-varying parameter regression models. DMS methods allow for model switching, where a different model can be chosen at each point in time. Thus, they allow for the explanatory variables in the time-varying parameter regression model to change over time. DMA will carry out model averaging in a time-varying manner. We compare our exact method for implementing DMA/DMS to a popular existing procedure which relies on the use of forgetting factor approximations. In an application, we use DMS to select different predictors in an inflation forecasting application. We find strong evidence of model switching. We also compare different ways of implementing DMA/DMS and find forgetting factor approaches and approaches based on the switching Gaussian state space model to lead to similar results.",C,611

These two techniques were applied in the dereplication and identification of bioactive compounds from a Streptomyces sp. (SM8) isolated from the sponge Haliclona simulans from Irish waters. Streptomyces strain SM8 extracts showed antibacterial and antifungal activity. NMR analysis of the active fractions proved that hydroxylated saturated fatty acids were the major components present in the antibacterial fractions. Antimycin compounds were initially putatively identified in the antifungal fractions using LC-Orbitrap. Their presence was later confirmed by comparison to a standard. Genomic analysis of
Streptomyces sp. SM8 revealed the presence of multiple secondary metabolism gene clusters, including a gene cluster for the biosynthesis of the antifungal antimycin family of compounds. The antimycin gene cluster of Streptomyces sp. SM8 was inactivated by disruption of the antimycin biosynthesis gene ant C. Extracts from this mutant strain showed loss of antimycin production and significantly less antifungal activity than the wild-type strain.

Ferrihydrite was exposed to Tc(VII)(aq) containing cement leachates (pH 10.5-13.1), and crystallization of magnetite was induced via addition of Fe(II)aq. A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD), chemical extraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques provided direct evidence that Tc(VII) was reduced and incorporated into the magnetite structure. Subsequent air oxidation of the magnetite particles for up to 152 days resulted in only limited remobilization of the incorporated Tc(IV). Analysis of both X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data indicated that the Tc(IV) was predominantly incorporated into the magnetite octahedral site in all systems studied. On reoxidation in air, the incorporated Tc(IV) was recalcitrant to oxidative dissolution with less than 40% remobilization to solution despite significant oxidation of the magnetite to maghemite/goethite: All solid associated Tc remained as Tc(IV). The results of this study provide the first direct evidence for significant Tc(IV) incorporation into the magnetite structure and confirm that magnetite incorporated Tc(IV) is recalcitrant to oxidative dissolution. Immobilization of Tc(VII) by reduction and incorporation into magnetite at high pH and with significant stability upon reoxidation has clear and important implications for limiting technetium migration under conditions where magnetite is formed including in geological disposal of radioactive wastes.",B & L,239

Establishing a good understanding of these mechanisms would help process design and control aiming at achieving desired quality of the components to be formed. This paper presents a study and the results on the sintering kinetics of the powder during Micro-FAST for the fabrication of micro-gears (the module is 0.2 and the pitch diameter 1.6 mm) from copper powder. The results showed that the densification of copper powder is related largely to the bulk plastic-deformations of the particles and the melting of the particles at contact interfaces. Particularly, it is revealed that plastic deformations of the copper particles mainly occurred at approximately 340 °C and melting of the particle-interfaces at approximately 640 °C. Differently, in a densification process with a traditional powder sintering method, grain growth and neck growth would, normally, be two dominant mechanisms that achieve the densification of powder.",E & A,105
A,A CFD model for the frictional resistance prediction of antifouling coatings,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-cfd-model-for-the-frictional-resistance-prediction-of-antifouli,"The fuel consumption of a ship is strongly influenced by her frictional resistance, which is directly affected by the roughness of the hull׳s surface. Increased hull roughness leads to increased frictional resistance, causing higher fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. It would therefore be very beneficial to be able to accurately predict the effects of roughness on resistance. This paper proposes a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model which enables the prediction of the effect of antifouling coatings on frictional resistance. It also outlines details of CFD simulations of resistance tests on coated plates in a towing tank. Initially, roughness functions and roughness Reynolds numbers for several antifouling coatings were evaluated using an indirect method. Following this, the most suitable roughness function model for the coatings was employed in the wall-function of the CFD software. CFD simulations of towing tests were then performed and the results were validated against the experimental data given in the literature. Finally, the effects of antifouling coatings on the frictional resistance of a tanker were predicted using the validated CFD model.",A & B & C & D,938

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between uraemia, haemodialysis and early AVF failure.  Immunoblotting and cell proliferation assays were performed on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) cells isolated from long saphenous vein samples to evaluate the cells' ability to proliferate when stimulated with uraemic (post-dialysis) and hyperuraemic (pre-dialysis) serum. Clinical data was collected prospectively for 569 consecutive radiocephalic (RCF) and brachiocephalic (BCF) fistulae. The primary outcome was AVF failure at 6 weeks. Dialysis status (haemodialysis (HD); pre-dialysis (Pre-D)), eGFR and serum urea were evaluated to determine if they affected early AVF failure.  Human VSM cells demonstrated increased capacity to proliferate when stimulated with hyperuraemic serum. There was no significant difference in early failure rate of either RCF or BCF depending on dialysis status (pre-D RCF 31.4% (n = 188); pre-D BCF 22.4% (n = 165); HD RCF 29.3% (n = 99); HD BCF 25.9% (n = 116); p = 0.34). There was no difference in mean eGFR between those patients with early AVF failure and those without (11.2+/-0.2 ml/min/1.73 m2 vs. 11.6+/-0.4 ml/min/1.73 m2 ; p = 0.47). Uraemia was associated with early AVF failure (serum urea: 35.0+/-0.7 mg/dl vs. 26.6+/-0.3 mg/dl (p < 0.001)).  We present the first in vivo evidence of an association between adverse early AVF outcomes and uraemia.

E,Resveratrol and its oligomers: modulation of sphingolipid metabolism and signaling in disease,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/resveratrol-and-its-oligomers-modulation-of-sphingolipid-metaboli,"Resveratrol, a natural compound endowed with multiple health-promoting effects, has received much attention given its potential for the treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, metabolic and age-related diseases. However, the translational potential of resveratrol has been limited by its specificity, poor bioavailability and uncertain toxicity. In recent years, there has been an accumulation of evidence demonstrating that resveratrol modulates sphingolipid metabolism. Moreover, resveratrol forms higher order oligomers that exhibit better selectivity and potency in modulating sphingolipid metabolism. This review evaluates the evidence supporting the modulation of sphingolipid metabolism and signaling as a mechanism of action underlying the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol and oligomers in diseases, such as cancer.",K & L & M,899
B,Model based wind turbine gearbox fault detection on SCADA data,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/model-based-wind-turbine-gearbox-fault-detection-on-scada-data,"Developing effective wind turbine fault detection algorithm is not only meaningful for improving wind turbine reliability but also crucial for future intelligent wind farm operation and management. Typical wind turbine gearbox condition monitoring is based on vibration signals, which is effective to
detect failures with high frequency signal range. But it may not be effective on low speed components which have low frequency signal characteristic of different failure modes. SCADA system collecting multiple low frequency signals provides a cost-effective way to monitor wind turbines health and performance, while its capability on fault detection is still an open issue. To systematic understand wind turbine systems, this paper presents research results of model based wind turbine gearbox fault detection. Through a detail analysis of thermodynamic process of gearbox lubrication system, a wind
turbine drive train model which considers heat transferring mechanism in gearbox lubrication system is built to derive robust relationships between transmission efficiency, temperature, and rotational speed signals of wind turbine gearbox and suggest useful information for lubrication system
design and optimization. The result obtained in this work is useful for wind turbine gearbox design and effective algorithm development of fault detection.",M & A,672
D,The North Atlantic Ocean as habitat for Calanus finmarchicus: environmental factors and life history traits,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-north-atlantic-ocean-as-habitat-for-calanus-finmarchicus-envi,"This paper addresses relationships between the distribution and abundance of zooplankton and its habitat in the northern North Atlantic Ocean. Distributions of ten representative zooplankton taxa, from recent (2000-2009) Continuous Plankton Recorder data, are presented, along with basin-scale patterns of annual sea surface temperature and phytoplankton color.  The distribution patterns represent the manifestation of very different physiological, life history and ecological interactions of each taxon with the North Atlantic habitat characteristics. The paper then focuses on a pan-Atlantic compilation of demographic and life history information for the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, perhaps one of the most ecologically important and certainly the most studied zooplankton species in the North Atlantic. Abundance, dormancy, egg production and mortality in relation to temperature and phytoplankton biomass, using chlorophyll a as a proxy, are analyzed in the context of understanding factors involved in determining the distribution and abundance of C. finmarchicus across its range. Several themes emerge:  (1)  transport of C. finmarchicus is from the south to the north in the northeast Atlantic, but from the north to the south in the western North Atlantic, which has implications for understanding population responses to climate forcing on coastal shelves, , (2) recruitment to the youngest copepodite stages occurs during or just after the phytoplankton bloom in the east while it occurs after the bloom in many western sites, (3) while the deep basins in the Labrador Sea and Norwegian Sea are primary sources of C. finmarchicus production,  the western North Atlantic marginal seas have an important role in sustaining high C. finmarchicus abundance on the western North Atlantic shelves, (4) differences in mean temperature and chlorophyll concentration between the western and eastern North Atlantic are reflected in regional differences in female body size and egg production responses, (5) differences in functional responses in egg production rate may reflect genetic differences between western and eastern populations, (6) dormancy duration is generally shorter in the deep waters adjacent to the lower latitude western North Atlantic shelves than in the east, and (7) differences in stage-specific mortality rates are related to bathymetry, temperature and potential predators, notably the abundance of congeners Calanus hyperboreus and C. glacialis, which likely feed on early life stages of C. finmarchicus. Two modeling approaches have previously been used to interpret the abundance and distribution of C. finmarchicus in relation to the North Atlantic habitat. A statistical approach based on ecological niche theory and a dynamical modeling approach, based on knowledge of spatial population dynamics and life history and implemented by recent developments in coupled physical-life cycle modeling. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are discussed. A synthesis of the two modeling approaches to predict North Atlantic zooplankton species shifts, not only for C. finmarchicus, but also for other major taxa, is advocated. While the computational resource requirements and lack of species-specific life history information for physical-biological modeling hinder full application for many zooplankton taxa, use of the approach, where possible, to understand advective influences will provide insight for interpretation of statistical predictions from species distribution models.",B & C,746
A,Experimental study of a hybrid mooring system,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/experimental-study-of-a-hybrid-mooring-system,"Mooring systems are essential to the floating structures including offshore platforms, wave energy converters and floating breakwaters. As floating structures propagate towards deeper waters, the design of the mooring systems needs to be revamped. In the present study, a new hybrid mooring system has been proposed. A series of weights and buoys are arranged to the different segments of each mooring line in order to improve the motion performance of the platform and eliminate the vertical forces at the lower end of the mooring lines. A series of experiments have been carried out at CSSRC wave basin for a semi-submersible platform moored by the mooring lines with or without the weights and buoys. The mooring lines’ tension and 6-DOF motions of the platform were measured. Discussions have been made on non-linear motion responses of the semi-submersible and non-linear mooring line tension responses for various mooring conditions.",B & C & D,176
E,Techno-economic investigation of alternative propulsion plants for ferries and RoRo ships,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/techno-economic-investigation-of-alternative-propulsion-plants-fo,"In this paper, the main alternative propulsion plants based on reciprocating internal combustion engines of a ferry or RoRo ship operating in routes that include Emission Control Areas (ECAs) are comparatively assessed. Specifically, a dual fuel engine propulsion plant is compared with a conventional Diesel engine plant. For both cases, the installation of a Waste Heat Recovery system, which covers a part of the ship electric energy demand, is also considered. The ship main DF engines are assumed to operate using LNG and a small amount of MDO for initiating combustion, whereas low sulphur MDO was regarded as the fuel for the case of the Diesel engine plant. The installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) after-treatment unit for reducing the NOx emissions for the case of Diesel engines plant is also taken into account. The propulsion plants were modelled under steady state conditions, and the simulation results were analysed in order to compare the alternative configurations. Furthermore, the energy efficiency design index (EEDI) values were calculated and the two examined propulsion system cases were compared on EEDI basis. Finally, the Life Cycle Cost for each alternative propulsion plant was calculated and used for completing an economic evaluation of the Dual fuel propulsion plant versus the conventional designs applied in ferries.",E & F,142
C,Effect of harmonics on pulse sequence analysis plots from electrical trees,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effect-of-harmonics-on-pulse-sequence-analysis-plots-from-electri,"This paper investigates the effect of harmonic pollution on the Pulse Sequence Analysis (PSA) pattern. Partial discharge data was captured from electrical trees growing in epoxy resin in the presence of different harmonic regimes. These regimes included 50Hz waveforms polluted with 3rd, 5th, 7th, 11th, 13th, 23rd and 25th order harmonics, at varying levels of Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and waveshape factor (KS). In this paper, the data has been analyzed using PSA by plotting the external voltage of consecutive PD pulses (un vs un-1). Under pure 50 Hz conditions, four clusters of data points can be identified in the plot and the formation of the clusters is discussed. Further investigation was performed by running the samples to breakdown. The results show that even in the presence of harmonics, an increase of PD occurrence and phase distribution translates into the expected PSA pattern, where clusters of data points merge to form a 45° straight line. Therefore, PSA is relatively immune to the effects of harmonic distortion when considering it only as an indicator of breakdown.",H & J,226
C,National Geographic: understand civil engineering differently,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/national-geographic-understand-civil-engineering-differently,"Our undergraduate civil engineering students have access to a rich and diverse bank of textual and graphical knowledge concerning their chosen profession. However, over a number of decades, commentators have raised concerns that our students have insufficient understanding of the role of civil engineering in society. Indeed, the call for universities to educate   ‘global engineers’ emphasises the need for our students to be schooled in the humanities, in parallel with their core computational studies. Unfortunately, engineering students in particular, are not accustomed to regular exploratory reading. This paper considers the use of the National Geographic magazine as a means to ignite our students’ curiosity with the world around them. The results from a  pilot study and a content analysis of a number of editions from over a decade shows that this periodical regularly carries themes directly concerning the impact of civil engineering in society, be it political , financial  environmental , social  or ecological.",L & K & C,413

E,Novel treatment strategies for schizophrenia from improved understanding of genetic risk,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/novel-treatment-strategies-for-schizophrenia-from-improved-unders,"Recent years have seen significant advances in our understanding of the genetic basis of schizophrenia. In particular, genome-wide approaches have suggested the involvement of many common genetic variants of small effect, together with a few rare variants exerting relatively large effects. While unequivocal identification of the relevant genes has, for the most part, remained elusive, the genes revealed as potential candidates can in many cases be clustered into functionally-related groups which are potentially open to therapeutic intervention. In this review, we summarise this information, focussing on the accumulating evidence that genetic dysfunction at glutamatergic synapses and post-synaptic signalling complexes contributes to the aetiology of the disease. In particular, there is converging support for involvement of post-synaptic JNK pathways in disease aetiology. An expansion of our neurobiological knowledge of the basis of schizophrenia is urgently needed, yet some promising novel pharmacological targets can already be discerned.",F & L & B,312
A,Thermal sprayed protective coatings for superplastic forming ceramic dies: a monitoring system of die condition,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/thermal-sprayed-protective-coatings-for-superplastic-forming-cera,"Superplastic forming (SPF) is an advanced sheet manufacturing process typically restricted to low volume and high value products. SPF ceramic dies have a lower production cost than conventional metal tools, and have short leadtimes, but their brittle nature is a limiting factor for SPF applications. Suitable surface treatments have a remarkable effect on wear resistance; hence, the working surface of the die can be improved by the application of appropriate coatings, increasing the lifetime of the SPF ceramic dies. Thermal spray is a promising deposition method, since numerous coating solutions are achievable without expensive vacuum technology. This paper describes a method for the investigation of surface degradation mechanisms in ceramic dies during SPF process at laboratory scale. Greater emphasis is given to the application of thermal sprayed coatings and quantification of their protection properties. At the Advanced Forming Research Centre is been designed a dedicated test rig used for simulate the die part interface at SPF condition. The aim of this study is to develop and to implement a monitoring system of working surface condition by which it is possible to predict the ceramic dies lifetime improvement for different thermal sprayed coatings.",E,252
B,"Disabled Children and Child Protection in Scotland: An Investigation into the Relationship between Professional Practice, Child Protection and Disability",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/disabled-children-and-child-protection-in-scotland-an-investigati-2,"This project was commissioned by the Scottish Government Children's Rights and Wellbeing Division to investigate the relationship between disabled children and child protection practice. Through interviews and focus groups the researchers spoke with 61 professionals working on issues of disabled children and child protection in Scotland.
Disabled children are more likely to be abused than their non-disabled peers, but there is evidence to suggest that the abuse of disabled children sometimes goes undetected. Getting it right for every child does not mean treating every child the same. There is a lack of confidence in working with disabled children, a lack of relevant training and variability in thresholds for action. Whilst there are positive aspects, this research shows that the child protection system is a cause for concern in relation to disabled children.",A,594
A,Development of wearable sensors for tailored patient wound care,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/development-of-wearable-sensors-for-tailored-patient-wound-care,"In recent years a specialist interest has developed worldwide in advanced wound management for difficult to heal chronic wounds. Further progress in advanced wound management will require an improvement in personalized medicine for the patient and in particular an improvement in the availability of diagnostic tests and parameters that fulfil clinical need in wound management decisions. However, without easy to use sensors for nurses and carers these potentially important near-patient diagnostic parameters will not enter clinical diagnostics. This study focuses on a number of metrics for wound condition and wound healing: wound fluid pH, wound moisture, and wound matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) enzyme activity. To observe these important markers state of the art sensors have been developed that are based on inexpensive sensing technologies that can be integrated within wound dressings. These sensors will enable the wound healing markers to be studied and profiled in clinics which will further enhance the understanding of these markers and their relationship in the complex healing process involved in chronic wound healing.",G & H,497

B,γ-ray generation enhancement by the charge separation field in laser-target interaction in the radiation dominated regime,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/%CE%B3-ray-generation-enhancement-by-the-charge-separation-field-in-la,A new source of radiation can be created with a laser pulse of intensity 1023W/cm2 interacting with a slightly overdense plasma. Collective effects driven by the electrostatic field significantly enhance the synchrotron radiation. They impact on the laser energy repartition leading to a specific emission but also constitute a crucial element for the intense radiation production. They allow electrons to be accelerated over a length up to 10 laser wavelengths favoring emission of an intense radiation. It is shown that charge separation field depends on the ion mass and target thickness but also on laser polarization. These phenomena are studied with an one dimensional relativistic particle-in-cell code accounting for the classical radiation reaction force.,L,195

The tool is used in a number of areas in Scotland but had not previously been comprehensively tested for use with this population. The study looked at the results from more than 1,100 YLS/CMI risk assessments and found that it was a good predictor of reoffending for both males and females. The findings showed that the YLS/CMI was not very accurate at assessing the likelihood of reoffending if it was used with young people outside of the intended age range. The study also highlighted that when practitioners used the professional override then the accuracy of the YLS/CMI was often reduced. The findings support the use of the YLS/CMI within social work for information practice and decision-making, but highlight the need for further research to better understand how practitioners apply their professional judgement.",D & L,327
A,The influence of structure on reactivity in alkene metathesis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-structure-on-reactivity-in-alkene-metathesis,"Abstract Alkene metathesis has grown from a niche technique to a common component of the synthetic organic chemistry toolbox, driven in part by the development of more active catalyst systems, or those optimized for particular purposes. While the range of synthetic chemistry achieved has been exciting, the effects of structure on reactivity have not always been particularly clear, and rarely quantified. Understanding these relationships is important when designing new catalysts, reactions, and syntheses. Here, we examine what is known about the effect of structure on reactivity from two perspectives: the catalyst, and the substrate. The initiation of the precatalyst determines the rate at which active catalyst enters the catalytic cycle; the rate and selectivity of the alkene metathesis reaction is dependent on how the substrate and active catalyst interact. The tools deployed in modern studies of mechanism and structure/activity relationships in alkene metathesis are discussed.",A & B & C & D,820
B,Structural and reactivity insights in Mg–Zn hybrid chemistry: Zn–I exchange and Pd-catalysed cross-coupling applications of aromatic substrates,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/structural-and-reactivity-insights-in-mgzn-hybrid-chemistry-zni-e,"Expanding the synthetic potential of Mg-Zn hybrid organyl reagents (generated via transmetallation reactions), this study uncovers a versatile approach, involving a sequence of direct Zn-I exchange and Pd catalysed cross-coupling reactions which grants access to a wide range of asymmetric bis(aryls). By combining X-ray crystallography with ESI-MS and non-deuterium NMR spectroscopic studies, new light is shed on the heterobimetallic constitution of the intriguing organometallic species [(THF)4MgCl 2Zn(tBu)Cl] (1) and [{Mg2Cl3(THF) 6}+{ZntBu3}-] (2), formed through transmetallation of tBuMgCl with n equivalent amounts of ZnCl2 (n = 1 and 3 respectively). Operating by cooperative effects, alkyl-rich hybrid 2 can effectively promote direct Zn-I exchange reactions with aromatic halides in short periods of time at room temperature in THF solution. The structural elucidation of key organometallic intermediates involved in some of these Zn-I exchanges, provides new reactivity insights into how these bimetallic systems operate. Thus, while the reaction of 2 with 3 equivalents of 2-iodoanisole (3b) gives magnesium dizincate [{Mg(THF)6}2+{Zn(o-C 6H4-OMe)3}2
-] (4) which demonstrates the 3-fold activation of the tBu groups attached to Zn in 2, using 2-iodobenzonitrile (3i), only two tBu groups react with the substrate, affording [(THF)4MgCl(NC-o-C6H4)ZnI(o-C 6H4-CN)(THF)] (7). In 7 Mg and Zn are connected by an aryl bridge, suggesting that the formation of contacted ion-pair hybrids may have a deactivating effect on the outcome of the Zn-I exchange process. A wide range of homoleptic tris(aryl) zincate intermediates have been prepared in situ and used as precursors in Pd catalysed cross-coupling reactions, affording bis(aryls) 6a-s in excellent yields under mild reaction conditions without the need of any additive or polar cosolvent such as NMP or DMI.",E & F & G,363
C,Dynamical systems techniques for designing libration point orbits in proximity of highly-inhomogeneous planetary satellites: Application to the Mars-Phobos elliptic three-body problem with additional gravity harmonics,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dynamical-systems-techniques-for-designing-libration-point-orbits,"The orbital dynamics around the Libration points of the classical circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP) have been investigated in detail: in the last few decades, dynamical systems theory has provided invaluable analytical and numerical tools for understanding the dynamics of Libration Point Orbits (LPOs). The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon’s surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system. Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics. The proposed methodology allows us to identify natural periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that would provide unique low-cost opportunities for close-range observations around Phobos and high-performance landing/take-off pathways to and from Phobos’ surface, which could be exploited in upcoming missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon.",H,200
D,Growth and characterization of highly mismatched GaN1-xSbx alloys,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/growth-and-characterization-of-highly-mismatched-gansub1-xsubsbsu,"A systematic investigation on the effects of growth temperature, Ga flux, and Sb flux on the incorporation of Sb, film structure, and optical properties of the GaN1-xSbx highly mismatched alloys (HMAs) was carried out. We found that the direct bandgap ranging from 3.4 eV to below 1.0 eV for the alloys grown at low temperature. At the growth temperature of 80 degrees C, GaN1-xSbx with x>6% losses crystallinity and becomes primarily amorphous with small crystallites of 2-5 nm. Despite the range of microstructures found for GaN1-xSbx alloys with different composition, a well-developed absorption edge shifts from 3.4 eV (GaN) to close to 2 eV for samples with a small amount, less than 10% of Sb. Luminescence from dilute GaN1-xSbx alloys grown at high temperature and the bandgap energy for alloys with higher Sb content are consistent with a localized substitutional Sb level E-Sb at similar to 1.1 eV above the valence band of GaN. The decrease in the bandgap of GaN1-xSbx HMAs is consistent with the formation of a Sb-derived band due to the anticrossing interaction of the Sb states with the valence band of GaN.",I & J,382

These systems are the only proper fluid ferroelectrics confirmed experimentally so far. We consider a molecular theory of proper ferroelectric ordering in isotropic, nematic and smectic A phases and conclude that the delicate balance between the tendencies for local parallel and antiparallel ordering of molecular electric and steric dipoles is strongly shifted in restricted geometries. This is a reason why dipolar ordering is more likely to occur within a smectic layer. We derive model interaction potentials for polar bent-core molecules and present the results of the mean-field theory of ferroelectric ordering in the orthogonal smectic phase taking into account also the molecular biaxiality. Order parameter profiles have been calculated numerically and phase diagrams are presented which enable one to analyze the relative importance of dipole-dipole interaction and intermolecular attraction modulated by polar bent-core molecular shape.",K & L & M,362

A,Mechanical stimulation of the foot sole in a supine position for ground reaction force simulation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/mechanical-stimulation-of-the-foot-sole-in-a-supine-position-for-,"To promote early rehabilitation of walking, gait training can start even when patients are on bed rest. Supine stepping in the early phase after injury is proposed to maximise the beneficial effects of gait restoration. In this training paradigm, mechanical loading on the sole of the foot is required to mimic the ground reaction forces that occur during overground walking. A pneumatic shoe platform was developed to produce adjustable forces on the heel and the forefoot with an adaptable timing. This study aimed to investigate the stimulation parameters of the shoe platform to generate walking-like loading on the foot sole, while avoiding strong reflexes.  This study evaluated this platform in ten able-bodied subjects in a supine position. The platform firstly produced single-pulse stimulation on the heel or on the forefoot to determine suitable stimulation parameters, then it produced cyclic stimulation on the heel and the forefoot to simulate the ground reaction forces that occur at different walking speeds. The ankle angle and electromyography (EMG) in the tibialis anterior (TA) and soleus (SOL) muscles were recorded. User feedback was collected.  When the forefoot or/and the heel were stimulated, reflexes were observed in the lower leg muscles, and the amplitude increased with force. Single-pulse stimulation showed that a fast-rising force significantly increased the reflex amplitudes, with the possibility of inducing ankle perturbation. Therefore a slow-rising force pattern was adopted during cyclic stimulation for walking. The supine subjects perceived loading sensation on the foot sole which was felt to be similar to the ground reaction forces during upright walking. The EMG generally increased with force amplitude, but no reflex-induced ankle perturbations were observed. The mean change in the ankle joint induced by the stimulation was about 1[degree sign].  The rate of force increase should be carefully adjusted for simulation of walking-like loading on the foot sole. It is concluded that the dynamic shoe platform provides adjustable mechanical stimulation on the heel and the forefoot in a supine position and has technical potential for simulation of ground reaction forces that occur during walking.",B & C & D,843

C,Computer assisted knee replacement surgery: is the movement mainstream?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/computer-assisted-knee-replacement-surgery-is-the-movement-mainst,"The first computer-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) was performed in 1997. The FDA approved computer
 assisted knee arthroplasty systems used in the early 2000s. Since then, surgeons and institutions all over the world
 have gradually adopted the technology. While the computer holds an importance place in the majority of workspaces
 across all industries, computer-assisted surgical technique has yet to become the preferred tool of the orthopaedic
 surgeon. Why has ""e-instrumentation"" not yet substituted conventional instrumentation in TKA orthopaedic surgery?
 In this article, we argue that main reasons which oppose the use of this technology are based on inaccurate or
 misleading observations. We isolated the factors likely to explain such opposition to this innovation: current results of
 total knee replacement, surgeon age, operative time, system ergonomics, cost for users, and cost for suppliers and
 ""disruptive"" innovations. Other factors such as surgeon habits, hospital environment and available assistance for
 support, although relevant, are not discussed. We assessed the advantages and drawbacks, costs and benefits of
 this technology to assess whether or not this opposition is justified. Finally, we explored the reasons why such a
 technology may impel surgeons to use this technique or any ""related technologies"" in the future.
 The main factors limiting TKA navigation spreading amongst orthopaedic surgeons are ergonomics and
 economics. Other factors, such as current TKA outcomes and surgeon's age are fallacious arguments in the rebuttal
 of CAS system use. Computer assisted knee arthroplasty surgery is not yet mainstream, but TKA will not escape

D,Community of philosophical inquiry:  citizenship in Scottish classrooms,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/community-of-philosophical-inquiry-citizenship-in-scottish-classr,"The context for the study is the current curriculum reform in Scotland (Curriculum for Excellence) which demands that teachers enable children to become ‘Responsible Citizens’. Education for Citizenship, as opposed to Citizenship Education, in Scotland is not a discrete subject; the objective is that citizenship permeates everything that happens throughout school, academically and socially. It is centrally situated alongside children becoming ‘effective contributors’, ‘successful learners’ and ‘confident individuals’. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of Community of Philosophical Inquiry (CoPI) as a pedagogical tool to enhance citizenship attributes in Scottish children in a range of educational settings. In order, first, to get an insight into the teachers’ perspectives on the Education for Citizenship agenda in Scotland, the teachers were asked for their definitions of ‘citizen’. Similarly, the children were also asked about their notion of ‘citizen’. The children’s group betrayed a more political understanding of ‘citizen’ than the teachers. Before and after an extended series of CoPI sessions, the 133 participating children from the ages of five to eighteen, in formal and informal educational contexts, were presented with dilemmas designed to elicit responses which indicated their ability to make, what Curriculum for Excellence (Scottish Executive, 2004) would describe as ‘informed choices and decisions and to articulate informed, ethical views of complex issues’. The sessions were facilitated by class teachers who were trained in CoPI. The results indicate that children’s reason giving was enhanced by participation in CoPI. The article uses contributions from the children to highlight areas of their lives within school and in society beyond school, where
doing philosophy has had an impact. The implications both for education for citizenship and the potential of Philosophy with Children to contribute to an enhanced school curriculum will also be discussed.",A & D,851

The comb spacing was referenced to a Rb-stabilized microwave synthesizer and the comb offset was stabilized by generating a super-continuum containing a coherent component at 780.2 nm which was heterodyned with a 87Rb-stabilized external cavity diode laser to produce a radio-frequency beat used to actuate the carrier-envelope offset frequency of the Yb-fiber laser.

The determinations of the specific changes were carried out by means of impulse excitation, ultrasonic time-of-flight and near infrared spectroscopy. The results show, that the stiffness and density decrease was linear with time, with no evidence of a slowing rate of degradation even at 140ºC, after loss of more than half the
original wood stiffness and more than a quarter of the original mass. At all temperatures the ratio between the longitudinal modulus and shear modulus was unchanged by the treatment for individual samples and the stiffness change was proportional to mass loss irrespective of the temperature and time. Examination of the NIR spectra revealed modifications in the amorphous carbohydrates structure and small changes in the lignin structure.",E,314

For example, P. aeruginosa is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Here, we describe how Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to detect the presence of four different strains of P. aeruginosa. Using a low cost, screen printed carbon electrode significant changes can be seen in impedance data in the presence of P. aeruginosa after 24 hours. Furthermore, through the use of a normalization technique whereby the phase angle of the impedance (a commonly used parameter) is divided by a starting measurement, it is possible to identify differences between a non-mucoid and mucoid strain of P. aeruginosa. Sensors based upon the techniques described here could be used in a number of healthcare scenarios, where there is a need for low cost, real time detection of P. aeruginosa, such as CF.",A,357

However, the fundamental knowledge of the friction stir welding process in relation to steel remains relatively limited. A microstructure and property evaluation of friction stir welded low alloy steel grade DH36 plate, commonly used in ship and marine applications has been undertaken. In this comprehensive study, plates of 2000 x 200 x 6 mm were butt welded together at varying rotational and traverse speeds. Samples were examined microscopically and by transverse tensile tests. In addition, the work was complemented by Charpy impact testing and micro-hardness testing in various regions of the weld. The study examined a wide range of process parameters; from this, a preliminary process parameter envelope has been developed and initial process parameter sets established that produce commercially attractive excellent quality welds through a substantial increase in the conventionally recognised weld traverse speed.",I & C & M,852

A small-scale experimental co-crystal screen has produced three novel co-crystals of alpha-lipoic acid that each display enhanced thermal stability and differences in aqueous solubilities compared to alpha-lipoic acid. In each case, the initial screening procedure produced tens of milligrams of material enabling initial identification, characterisation and crystal structure determination. The structure of the alpha-lipoic acid : nicotinamide co-crystal was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction and used for subsequent phase identification. Scale-up of the co-crystallisation process of alpha-lipoic acid with nicotinamide was then investigated in a continuous oscillatory baffled crystalliser. Over 1 kg of solid co-crystals was produced using a continuous crystallisation process in a continuous oscillatory baffled crystalliser at a throughput of 350 g h-1 yielding a purity of 99% demonstrating this as an effective route to rapid scale-up of a novel co-crystal system.",L,957

However, they are rarely used in practice due to over-parameterization concerns, difficulties in ensuring identification and computational challenges. With the growing interest in multivariate time series models of high dimension, these problems with VARMAs become even more acute, accounting for the dominance of VARs in this field. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach for inference in VARMAs which surmounts these problems. It jointly ensures identification and parsimony in the context of an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. We use this approach in a macroeconomic application involving up to twelve dependent variables. We find our algorithm to work successfully and provide insights beyond those provided by VARs.",B & H,574
C,A reflection on construction mediation in Scotland,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-reflection-on-construction-mediation-in-scotland,"Recent research in different parts of the UK has pointed to growing acceptance of the mediation process from legal professionals with promises of potential costs savings for end-users. Nonetheless in many jurisdictions take up is low despite positive evidence relating to use and there is scant empirical knowledge about construction lawyers' role in the referral of cases to mediation and sophisticated evidence relative to lawyer and client interaction in the expediting use of the process. This paper draws upon recent work (both interview and questionnaire based)conducted over the past 24 months with construction lawyers and end-users relative to their experiences of mediation in the Scottish construction field. The findings reveal a small yet significant measure of generally successful mediation activity and growing support for the process among both lawyers and end-users. Nevertheless, barriers to mediation's acceptance remain well-grounded, both throughout legal and client circles and various solutions to overcoming such obstacles are examined in the paper. Evidence gleaned in Scotland has significance beyond its borders given the commonality of issues pertaining to mediation growth across all developing jurisdictions and the presence of a dominant adjudication regime which can be seen as a significant inhibiting factor in the use of mediation.",D & L,387

The Hamiltonian dynamics is derived and used to identify relative attitude equilibria of the system with respect to the orbital reference frame. Then a numerical investigation of the behaviour far from the equilibria is provided using tools from modern dynamical systems theory such as energy methods, phase portraits and Poincarè maps. Results reveal a complex structure of the configuration manifold underlying the dynamics as well as the existence of connections between some of the equilibria.

Propane and n-butane are evaluated as desorbent candidates. The study encompasses molecular simulation calculations for determination of adsorption parameters, whose results will then be used in a mathematical model for evaluating the performance of an SMB unit. This work is entirely done in silico, by using available force field parameters for the molecular simulations part and reliable mathematical models for the SMB part. Experimental data are solely used for comparison with the molecular simulation results, which are subsequently expanded to calculate adsorption properties for separating the mixtures, without further experimental work. The separation regions of an SMB unit operating with zeolite 13X for ethane/ethylene separation, using propane and n-butane as desorbents, were obtained by simulation at 110 kPa and at four different temperatures: 298, 323, 348 and 373 K.

A,Ionic liquids at electrified interfaces,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/ionic-liquids-at-electrified-interfaces,"Until recently, “room-temperature” (<100–150 °C) liquid-state electrochemistry was mostly electrochemistry of diluted electrolytes(1)–(4) where dissolved salt ions were surrounded by a considerable amount of solvent molecules. Highly concentrated liquid electrolytes were mostly considered in the narrow (albeit important) niche of high-temperature electrochemistry of molten inorganic salts(5-9) and in the even narrower niche of “first-generation” room temperature ionic liquids, RTILs (such as chloro-aluminates and alkylammonium nitrates).(10-14) The situation has changed dramatically in the 2000s after the discovery of new moisture- and temperature-stable RTILs.(15, 16) These days, the “later generation” RTILs attracted wide attention within the electrochemical community.(17-31) Indeed, RTILs, as a class of compounds, possess a unique combination of properties (high charge density, electrochemical stability, low/negligible volatility, tunable polarity, etc.) that make them very attractive substances from fundamental and application points of view.(32-38) Most importantly, they can mix with each other in “cocktails” of one’s choice to acquire the desired properties (e.g., wider temperature range of the liquid phase(39, 40)) and can serve as almost “universal” solvents.(37, 41, 42) It is worth noting here one of the advantages of RTILs as compared to their high-temperature molten salt (HTMS)(43) “sister-systems”.(44) In RTILs the dissolved molecules are not imbedded in a harsh high temperature environment which could be destructive for many classes of fragile (organic) molecules.",B & C & D,862
E,Internet access among the most income deprived: the case of Glasgow,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/internet-access-among-the-most-income-deprived-the-case-of-glasgo,"Glasgow is Scotland’s largest city and since 2009 it has seen stagnating levels of fixed broadband uptake (Ofcom, 2013). As recently as August 2013, Ofcom reported that fixed broadband uptake in Glasgow remained at 50%; this is significantly below the Scottish average of 68% (Ofcom, 2013). As the ‘Digital by Default’ agenda of the United Kingdom government, which places government services online, becomes ever more pervasive this becomes a more pressing issue for the city. That needs to find ways to increase broadband adoption. There is also a need to uncover the deep seated reasons why there has been no improvement in fixed broadband uptake in the last five years in Glasgow. Internet access is lowest amongst the most deprived in society and those with the lowest incomes (SHS, 2012). Analysis based on the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation highlights that ‘income deprivation in Glasgow City is greater than in Scotland as a whole’- 21.5% of Glasgow’s population were income deprived in 2012 (Scottish Government, 2012a, p3).
This paper focuses on the deprived areas of Glasgow and whether and how the most disadvantaged in the city use the Internet. The analysis draws on data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) and from individuals in deprived areas. This paper will investigate those who do and do not have access to the Internet to answer the following questions:
 In areas of deprivation what differentiates those who do and do not have access to the Internet?
 Do demographic or geographic factors have greater influence in determining whether a person has access to the Internet at home?
 What factors, other than demographics, influence the adoption of the Internet in areas of deprivation?
The attitude of individuals towards the Internet rather than demographic factors has been highlighted as an important factor in Glasgow (White, 2013). This paper takes this analysis a step further by targeting the most disadvantaged to ascertain whether neighbourhood effects or attitudes to technology are the most important. This will enable a greater understanding of how to engage those who do not use the Internet. It will also provide insight into the development of policy initiatives in Glasgow to address this particular issue.
Since geography plays an influential role in shaping public policy through, for instance, local politics, this paper will initially map the available demographic and economic data. Previous work in Glasgow on public Internet access in areas of deprivation highlighted specific areas of the city with low broadband uptake and high levels of deprivation (Anderson and Whalley, 2013). Although this paper continues in the same vain, it instead focuses on home Internet uptake in similarly deprived areas. This was accomplished by questioning people seeking benefits assistance at Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) across the city. CAB provides impartial advice to those who visit their offices. Each CAB is separately run, with its own funding from Glasgow City Council or other sources. They operate independently, almost like a franchise model. Due to
2
how they are funded, CABs are only meant to serve their immediate local community. Thus, where the CAB is positioned will have a huge effect on who visits. Targeting CAB provides valuable and insightful data from the most vulnerable and marginalised members of society. Those affected by the ‘Digital by Default’ program are the most likely to need to apply for benefits online and provide evidence of job searching to be entitled to benefits.
There are several components to the methodology adopted. Firstly, the responses of 950 individuals from eight CABs across the city were analysed to identify differences between those who do and do not have the Internet. This was combined with SIMD data using postcode information. Geographic analysis was also conducted on this data to identify differences between some of the most deprived communities in Glasgow. Secondly, a more detailed data collection on specific identified areas of the city concentrated on collecting information other than that related to the demographic barriers to Internet participation. This provided a further insight into the other barriers to adoption in areas of deprivation.
This paper provides valuable insight into the use and non-use of the Internet by the most disadvantaged in Glasgow. It is expected that the first question around the differences of who does and does not have the Internet will be answered by separating the data into groups of five per cent based on their SIMD income rank. This highlights a switching point which was then used as a reference for comparing multiple factors in the dataset. Moreover, this approach highlights that some income groups did not conform to the general pattern. Indeed it could be expected, based on the literature, that higher income would mean that they are more likely to use the Internet and have devices that they can connect to the Internet (Ofcom, 2013, p279). This pattern is not consistent with the analysis of Internet use, where the relationship is non-linear and some groups have higher or lower usage than expected. This highlights that income alone is not a determinant of whether an individual uses the Internet. It also shows that there are variations in use of the Internet and ownership of devices in areas of deprivation that require further investigation.
The second and third research questions focus on specific communities within the city. Communities provide different opportunities and barriers to Internet use, even within deprived areas. The geographic analysis of these areas of the city highlights the importance of place, the effects of geography on Internet use and the drivers and barriers specific to each community.
This paper provides further insight into Internet use in areas of deprivation that could be of use to similar cities. There are multiple organisations which could assist in addressing the diverse needs of communities in increasing Internet access. However, they will need to work together and be responsive to the diverse needs of these communities. The evidence also provides direction for Glasgow City Council on ways to engage the disconnected, move forward with their Digital Strategy and close the Digital chasm that exists in the city.",E & F,263

The objective of this paper is to study the association between cardiovascular risk factors and concurrent depressive symptoms in patients with three common cardiometabolic conditions: coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and diabetes. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed primary care data for N = 35537 with 1 of the above 3 conditions who underwent depression screening using the depressive subscale of hospital anxiety and depression score (HADS-D). We reviewed 4 cardiometabolic risk factors (Systolic Blood Pressure [SBP], Diastolic Blood Pressure [DBP], BMI and total cholesterol) recorded concurrently in all patients and HbA1c in patients with diabetes (n = 18453). We analysed the association between individual risk factor value and a positive HADS-D screening result (62;7) using logistic regression. Results: SBP and BMI were noted to have a non-linear ""J-shaped"" relationship with the probability of having a positive HADS-D and observed nadirs (levels with the lowest probability) of 148 mm Hg and 30.70 kg/m2, respectively. Total cholesterol and DBP found to have a weaker curvilinear association with concurrent depression symptoms and nadirs of 3.60 mmol/l and 74 mmHg. Among patients with Diabetes, HbA1c was also found to have a ""J-shaped"" relationship with probability of having a positive HADS-D with an observed nadir of 7.06% DCCT. The above relationships remain significant after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic status and number of co-morbid conditions. Conclusion: In patients with cardiometabolic disease, cardiovascular risk factor values at both extremes were associated with higher positive depression screening after adjusting for confounders. These findings have potentially important implications for clinical practice in relation to both risk stratification for depression and approaches to secondary prevention in individuals with cardiometabolic disease and merit further investigation to determine the nature and direction of the observed association.",H & J,780
C,The role of Mg in the crystallization of monohydrocalcite,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-role-of-mg-in-the-crystallization-of-monohydrocalcite,"Monohydrocalcite is a member of the carbonate family which forms in Mg-rich environments at a wide range of Mg/Ca ratios Mg 2+ aq/Ca 2+ aq ≥ 0.17 < 65. Although found in modern sedimentary deposits and as a product of biomineralization, there is a lack of information about its formation mechanisms and about the role of Mg during its crystallization. In this work we have quantitatively assessed the mechanism of crystallization of monohydrocalcite through in situ synchrotron-based small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) and off-line spectroscopic, microscopic and wet chemical analyses. Monohydrocalcite crystallizes via a 4-stage process beginning with highly supersaturated solutions from which a Mg-bearing, amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) precursor precipitates. This precursor crystallizes to monohydrocalcite via a nucleation-controlled reaction in stage two, while in stage three it is further aged through Ostwald-ripening at a rate of 1.8±0.1nm/h1/2. In stage four, a secondary Ostwald ripening process (66.3±4.3nm/h1/2) coincides with the release of Mg from the monohydrocalcite structure and the concomitant formation of minor hydromagnesite. Our data reveal that monohydrocalcite can accommodate significant amounts of Mg in its structure (χMgCO3=0.26) and that its Mg content and dehydration temperature are directly proportional to the saturation index for monohydrocalcite (SIMHC) immediately after mixing the stock solutions. However, its crystallite and particle size are inversely proportional to these parameters. At high supersaturations (SIMHC=3.89) nanometer-sized single crystals of monohydrocalcite form, while at low values (SIMHC=2.43) the process leads to low-angle branching spherulites. Many carbonates produced during biomineralization form at similar conditions to most synthetic monohydrocalcites, and thus we hypothesize that some calcite or aragonite deposits found in the geologic record that have formed at high Mg/Ca ratios could be secondary in origin and may have originally formed via a metastable monohydrocalcite intermediate.",L & K & C,924

For the low temperatures characteristic of photoionized plasmas, the experimentally derived rate coefficient is orders of magnitude larger than the previously recommended atomic data. The existing atomic data were also about 40% smaller than our measurements at temperatures relevant for collisionally ionized plasmas. Recent state-of-the-art theory has difficulty reproducing the detailed energy dependence of the DR spectrum.

A,Volumetric scale-up of smouldering remediation of contaminated materials,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/volumetric-scale-up-of-smouldering-remediation-of-contaminated-ma,"Smouldering remediation is a process that has been introduced recently to address non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contamination in soils and other porous media. Previous work demonstrated this process to be highly effective across a wide range of contaminants and soil conditions at the bench scale. In this work, a suite of 12 experiments explored the effectiveness of the process as operating scale was increased 1000-fold from the bench (0.003 m3 ) to intermediate (0.3 m3 ) and pilot field-scale (3 m3 ) with coal tar and petrochemical NAPLs. As scale increased, remediation efficiency of 97–99.95% was maintained. Smoul- dering propagation velocities of 0.6–14 × 10−5 m/s at Darcy air fluxes of 1.54–9.15 cm/s were consistent with observations in previous bench studies, as was the dependence on air flux. The pilot field-scale experiments demonstrated the robustness of the process despite heterogeneities, localised operation, controllability through airflow supply, and the importance of a minimum air flux for self-sustainability. Experiments at the intermediate scale established a minimum-observed, not minimum-possible, initial concentration of 12,000mg/kg in mixed oil waste, providing support for the expectation that lower thresholds for self-sustaining smouldering decreased with increasing scale. Once the threshold was exceeded, basic process characteristics of average peak temperature, destructive efficiency, and treatment velocity were relatively independent of scale.",G & H,687

Compared with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, the Langevin method is more efficient in simulating small Knudsen number flows. While it is well-known that the cell sizes and time steps should be smaller than the mean free path and the mean collision time, respectively, in DSMC simulations, the Langevin equation uses a drift term and a diffusion term to describe molecule movements, so no direct molecular collisions have to be modeled. This enables the Langevin simulation to proceed with a much larger time step than that in the DSMC method. Two critical issues in Langevin simulation are addressed in this paper. The first issue is how to reproduce the transport properties as that described by kinetic theory. Transport coefficients predicted by Langevin equation are obtained by using Green-Kubo formulae. The second issue is numerical scheme with boundary conditions. We present two schemes corresponding to small time step and large time step, respectively. For small time step, the scheme is similar to DSMC method as the update of positions and velocities are uncoupled; for large time step, we present an analytical solution of the hitting time, which is the crucial factor for accurate simulation. Velocity-Couette flow, thermal-Couette flow, Rayleigh-Bénard flow and wall-confined problem are simulated by using these two schemes. Our study shows that Langevin simulation is a promising tool to investigate small Knudsen number flows.",L,496
B,Modified fuzzy c-means clustering for automatic tongue base tumour extraction from MRI data,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/modified-fuzzy-c-means-clustering-for-automatic-tongue-base-tumou,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging modality to extract tumour regions to assist in radiotherapy and surgery planning. Extraction of a tongue base tumour from MRI is challenging due to variability in its shape, size, intensities and fuzzy boundaries. This paper presents a new automatic algorithm that is shown to be able to extract tongue base tumour from gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted (T1+Gd) MRI slices. In this algorithm, knowledge of tumour location is added to the objective function of standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) to extract the tumour region. Experimental results on 9 real MRI slices demonstrate that there is good agreement between manual and automatic extraction results with dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.77±0.08.",B & H,269
C,Interaction of atmospheric gases with ETS-10: a DFT study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/interaction-of-atmospheric-gases-with-ets-10-a-dft-study,"Density functional theory (DFT) was used to optimize the geometries and calculate the enthalpies for the interactions between polar (H2O), quadrupolar (CO2 and N2), and apolar (H2 and CH4) atmospheric gases with a cluster model of the Engelhard titanosilicate ETS-10 having sodium extra framework cations (Na-ETS-10). The DFT calculations were performed with different exchange–correlation functionals and were corrected for the basis set superposition error with the counterpoise method. The calculated enthalpies for the interaction of the five gases with Na-ETS-10 decrease in the order H2O > CO2 ≫ N2 ≈ CH4 > H2 and compare well with experimental data available in the literature. The enthalpies calculated at the M06-L/6-31++G(d,p) level of theory for the two extreme cases, i.e., strongest and weakest interactions, are −60.6 kJ/mol (H2O) and −12.2 kJ/mol (H2). Additionally, the calculated vibrational frequencies are in very good agreement, within the approximations of the method, with the characteristic vibrational modes of ETS-10 and of the interactions of gases with Na+ in the 12-membered channel in ETS-10.",D & L,693
A,The replication dilemma unravelled: how organizations enact multiple goals in routine transfer,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-replication-dilemma-unravelled-how-organizations-enact-multip,"I examine how organizations address the replication dilemma by imultaneously enacting contrasting goals while transferring routines across complex organizational settings. I address this issue by drawing on a qualitative case-based inquiry into the multiplicity of the routines’ ostensive and performative aspects in the context of routine transfer and exact replication.
The subject of inquiry is a leading electronics organization facing the dilemma of how to deal with simultaneous competing pressures to copy exactly (replicate) and change (innovate). I find that organizational members address this dilemma (1) by harnessing artifacts and communities to establish two sets of ostensive patterns and performances, one supporting alignment
(replication) and one improvement (innovation), and (2) by striving to maintain a dynamic balance between them by enacting them in different proportions. This allows offsetting competing goals and the related pressures both at specific points in time and over time. Building on these findings, I develop a theoretical framework that adds to the extant replication and routines
literatures, and the Carnegie account of routine transfer and goal balancing, by capturing (1) the microlevel, performative dynamics by which organizations unravel the replication dilemma in routines transfer while addressing competing goals and the associated pressures and (2) the role of the social and material features of context in the (re)production and transfer of routines",A & B & C & D,978
B,Exploratory study of sensitization in cryogenically cooled ferritic stainless steel welds,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/exploratory-study-of-sensitization-in-cryogenically-cooled-ferrit,"Enhanced cooling via forced convection using cryogenic liquid is an option for controlling grain growth in the heat affected zone (HAZ) of ferritic stainless steel welds which improves joint strength. However, this technique seems to alter the martensite distribution in the high-temperature heat affected zone (HTHAZ) which is a critical constituent in rating the susceptibility to sensitization in ferritic stainless steel grades; any such information is not available in the literature. Thus, it is imperative to establish the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization dynamics in the HTHAZ. This paper discusses the influence of cryogenic cooling on sensitization in an AISI 430 ferritic stainless steel weld. It is established that cryogenic cooling increases the cooling rate in the HTHAZ and reduces the martensite volume percent by an average of 20%. This reduction in martensite content in the HTHAZ increases the level of ditched structure in cryogenically cooled welds and yields more ferrite-martensite ditched grain boundaries than in conventional welds. Although the cryotreated welds exhibit greater ditched boundary, the structure is still classified as nonsensitized, since no single grain boundary is completely surrounded by ditches.",E & F & G,804

The argument is that decentralization contributes to variant patterns of political trust, defined by the relative strength of national trust and local trust, across countries. A multilevel analysis of East Asian countries shows that decentralization nurtures local trust in democracies, but decreases local trust in autocracies. Further, decentralization boosts national trust in autocracies, but not in democracies. Such a variant effect of decentralization sheds light on regime stability and viability in democratic and authoritarian countries.",H,522
D,Inflatable shape changing colonies assembling versatile smart space structures,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/inflatable-shape-changing-colonies-assembling-versatile-smart-spa-2,"Various plants have the ability to follow the sun with their flowers or leaves during the course of a day via a mechanism known as heliotropism. This mechanism is characterised by the introduction of pressure gradients between neighbouring motor cells in the plant׳s stem, enabling the stem to bend. By adapting this bio-inspired mechanism to mechanical systems, a new class of smart structures can be created. The developed overall structure is made up of a number of cellular colonies, each consisting of a central pressure source surrounded by multiple cells. After launch, the cellular arrays are deployed in space and are either preassembled or alternatively are attached together during their release or afterwards. A central pressure source is provided by a high-pressure storage unit with an integrated valve, which provides ingress gas flow to the system; the gas is then routed through the system via a sequence of valve operations and cellular actuations, allowing for any desired shape to be achieved within the constraints of the deployed array geometry. This smart structure consists of a three dimensional adaptable cellular array with fluid controlling Micro Electromechanical Systems (MEMS) components enabling the structure to change its global shape. The proposed MEMS components include microvalves, pressure sensors, mechanical interconnect structures, and electrical routing. This paper will also give an overview of the system architecture and shows the feasibility and shape changing capabilities of the proposed design with multibody dynamic simulations. Example applications of this lightweight shape changing structure include concentrators, mirrors, and communications antennas that are able to dynamically change their focal point, as well as substructures for solar sails that are capable of steering through solar winds by altering the sails׳ subjected area.",I & J,628
E,Editorial: Special issue on the 13th international workshop on the physics of compressible turbulent mixing,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/editorial-special-issue-on-the-13th-international-workshop-on-the,"The study of compressible turbulent mixing associated with Richtmyer-Meshkov (RM), Rayleigh-Taylor (RT), and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instabilities is motivated by diverse applications in science and engineering, including supersonic combustion, detonation, instability of collapsing gas bubbles, stratified flows in geophysical applications, chemical engineering, inertial confinement fusion (ICF), supernovae, and molecular clouds. Further, the interaction of shock waves with materials is also of interest in biomedical applications, such as fragmentation of cancer cells during shockwave chemotherapy and cavitation damage to human tissues during lithotripsy. In many of these applications, the Reynolds number is very high and the instabilities rapidly lead to turbulent mixing. In the case of ICF, which is regarded as a promising approach to controlled thermonuclear fusion: (1) these instabilities lead to the growth of perturbations on the interfaces within the capsules; (2) perturbations grow into the nonlinear regime by mode coupling and eventually cause mixing of materials; and (3) material mixing inhibits thermonuclear burning of the fuel.",K & L & M,772

The objective of the C2C project is to test a combination of new automation technology, non - conventional network operational practices (i.e., increased network interconnection), and commercial demand - side response (DSR) contracts. These changes will allow ENWL to increase interruptible demand and generation connections on a selection of trial circuits without resorting to conventional reinforcement measures.

Our results show that acquirers enjoy highly significant gains during the announcement period of FDI. Perhaps surprisingly, the highest gains are accrued to acquirers investing in countries with high political risk and high corruption ratings. The type of asset acquired has also a significant effect on the gains of acquirers’ shareholders, with the highest gains accrued to acquirers of physical assets. Also, investments in physical assets in EM with a high corruption rating elicit the highest gains. We contend that UK firms following resource-seeking strategies in EM with a high corruption rating are facilitated access to resources on favorable terms and this is viewed positively by the market participants. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications and the endogenous choice to expand internationally.",B & C,106
A,Experimental optimization of a passive planar rhombic micromixer with obstacles for effective mixing in a short channel length,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/experimental-optimization-of-a-passive-planar-rhombic-micromixer-,"This paper presents the performance of a passive planar rhombic micromixer with diamond-shaped obstacles and a rectangular contraction between the rhombi. The device was experimentally optimized using water for high mixing efficiency and a low pressure drop over a wide range of Reynolds numbers (Re = 0.1–117.6) by varying geometrical parameters such as the number of rhombi, the distance between obstacles and the contraction width. Due to the large amount of data generated, statistical methods were used to facilitate and improve the results of the analysis. The results revealed a rank of factors influencing mixing efficiency: Reynolds number > number of rhombi > contraction width > inter-obstacles distance. The pressure drop measured after three rhombi depends mainly on Re and inter-obstacle distance. The resulting optimum geometry for the low Re regime has a contraction width of 101 μm and inter-obstacles distance of 93 μm, while for the high Re regime a contraction width of 400 μm and inter-obstacle distance of 121 μm are more appropriate. These mixers enabled 80% mixing efficiency creating a pressure drop of 6.0 Pa at Re = 0.1 and 5.1 × 104 Pa at Re = 117.6, with a mixer length of 2.5 mm. To the authors' knowledge, the developed mixer is one of the shortest planar passive micromixers reported to date.",B & C & D,953

In this paper we discuss existing views that conceptualize creativity and innovation in this sector as a sequential developmental process following the principles of operations management. However, based on in-depth interviews with world-renowned chefs we argue for a systemic rather than sequential developmental process view. The reason for this is that the chefs interviewed understand the ‘creativity-part’ of the innovation process as an embodied experience often guided by intuition and the ‘innovation part’ as a process of social evaluation greatly dependent on the perception, knowledge and value judgement of the testers from the leading restaurant guides. The main implications of the findings go beyond the haute cuisine sector and open areas for future research on creativity and intuition more generally.",E & F,616

C,Evaluation of crystallization kinetics of adipic acid in an oscillatory baffled crystallizer,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluation-of-crystallization-kinetics-of-adipic-acid-in-an-oscil,"For solution crystallization, nucleation can be characterized by the maximum sub-cooling (or metastable limit), which is known to vary with numerous process parameters. The relationship between the metastable limit and cooling rate is of particular interest, as it can be utilized to derive nucleation kinetic parameters. However, this relationship is open to interpretation. This work presents the application of three such interpretations (Nývlt, Kubota and a population balance based method) to a cooling crystallization of adipic acid in an oscillatory baffled crystallizer, a relatively new type of crystallizer with increased studies and applications in continuous plug flow operation. It also considers the role the device employed to detect nucleation events plays in the derived kinetic parameters. The result of this study shows that although all three interpretations can reasonably predict the maximum sub-cooling over a tested range of cooling rates, the linear assumptions in the Nývlt and Kubota interpretations give increased deviations from the experimental data, in particular for faster cooling rates. In contrast to the two aforementioned models, the population balance based method maintains a minimal deviation across the whole range of cooling rates used. In addition, although the population balance method does not consider the sensitivity of detection tools in its implementation, while the Kubota method does, the sensitivity of nucleation detection is reflected in the derived nucleation rate constants.

This is done both for methane-air and multi-component fuel-air mixtures for lean and stoichiometric conditions. Two different methods are used to identify HRR correlations, and it is found that HRR correlations vary strongly with stoichiometry. For the methane mixture there exist alternative HRR markers, while for the multi-component fuel flame the above correlation is found to be inadequate. Alternative markers for the HRR visualization are thus proposed and their performance under turbulent conditions is evaluated using DNS data.",E,571

Thus, nowcasts, which are estimates of current values of macroeconomic variables, are becoming increasingly popular. This paper takes up the challenge of nowcasting Scottish GDP growth. Nowcasting in Scotland, currently a government oce region within the United Kingdom, is complicated due to data limitations. For instance, key nowcast predictors such as industrial production are unavailable. Accordingly, we use data on some non-traditional variables and investigate whether UK aggregates can help nowcast Scottish GDP growth. Such data limitations are shared by many other sub-national regions, so we hope this paper can provide lessons for other regions interested in developing nowcasting models.",A,533

Currently this market segment is predominately product-centric in which the common business model is to sell laser systems with two years warranty. However increasing competition within this segment is forcing some stakeholders to go further than the existing business model, and aim to build long-standing relationship between others. In this paper, the current structure and level of servitization in laser industries, the implications of higher levels of servitization for the various stakeholders of the industry, and the opportunities to develop and deliver higher levels of servitization are discussed.

Providing some aspects of flexibility might enhance their financial performance; fuel switching may prove to be an alternative option, offering operational flexibility over time, as well as significant financial benefits. Traditional investment analysis methods are considered marginally useful to analyse this case. Instead, the recent tools of time-dependent investment analysis are more appropriate, since they are not inherently restricted to immediate, irreversible decisions. In the present work, a time-dependent computational model is presented and applied in the case study of the Greek Power Sector, in order to estimate the potential advantages of the fuel switching concept. Moreover, the optimal timing of switching is derived, to ensure increasing yields of an average-capacity power-plant. The results of the research indicate significant financial benefits anticipated in most scenarios from applying fuel switching, compared to single-fuelled electricity generation units.

B,Inactivation of Streptomyces phage ɸC31 by 405 nm light: requirement for exogenous photosensitizers?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/inactivation-of-istreptomycesi-phage-%C9%B8c31-by-405-nm-light-require,"Exposure to narrowband violet-blue light around 405 nm wavelength can induce lethal oxidative damage to bacteria and fungi, however effects on viruses are unknown.  As photosensitive porphyrin molecules are involved in the microbicidal inactivation mechanism, and since porphyrins are absent in viruses, then any damaging effects of 405 nm light on viruses might appear unlikely.  This study used the bacteriophage ɸC31, as a surrogate for non-enveloped double-stranded DNA viruses, to establish whether 405 nm light can induce virucidal effects.  Exposure of ɸC31 suspended in minimal media, nutrient-rich media, and porphyrin solution, demonstrated differing sensitivity of the phage.  Significant reductions in phage titre occurred when exposed in nutrient-rich media, with ~3, 5 and 7-log10 reductions achieved after exposure to doses of 0.3, 0.5 and 1.4 kJ/cm2, respectively.  When suspended in minimal media a 0.3 log10 reduction (P=0.012) occurred after exposure to 306 J/cm2: much lower than the 2.7 and >2.5 log10 reductions achieved with the same dose in nutrient-rich, and porphyrin-supplemented media, suggesting inactivation is accelerated by the photo-activation of light-sensitive components in the media.  This study provides the first evidence of the interaction of narrowband 405 nm light with viruses, and demonstrates that viral susceptibility to 405 nm light can be significantly enhanced by involvement of exogenous photosensitive components.  The reduced susceptibility of viruses in minimal media, compared to that of other microorganisms, provides further evidence that the antimicrobial action of 405 nm light is predominantly due to the photo-excitation of endogenous photosensitive molecules such as porphyrins within susceptible microorganisms.",E & F & G,686
C,Should we measure professionalism with an index? A note on theory and practice in state legislative professionalism research,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/should-we-measure-professionalism-with-an-index-a-note-on-theory-,"Legislative professionalism has played a prominent role in state politics research for decades. Despite the attention paid to its causes and consequences, recent research has largely set aside questions about professionalism’s conceptualization and operationalization. Usually measuring it as an aggregate index, scholars theoretically and empirically treat professionalism as a unidimensional concept. In this article, we argue that exclusive use of aggregate indices can limit state politics research. Using a new dataset with almost 40 years of data on state legislative resources, salary, and session length, we reconsider the validity of using an index to study professionalism across the states. We evaluate the internal consistency of professionalism components over time, the relationship between components and the Squire Index, and the degree to which professionalism components are unidimensional using classical multidimensional scaling. We find enough commonality and enough variation between professionalism components to support a range of measurement strategies like the use of unidimensional indices (such as the Squire Index), disaggregating the components and analyzing their effects individually, or formulating multidimensional measures. Scholars should take care to choose the appropriate measure of the concept that best fits the causal relationships under examination.",H,257
D,Station-keeping for quasi-periodic orbits,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/station-keeping-for-quasi-periodic-orbits,"The shallow gravity gradient in the libration point regions enables manoeuvring at low ∆v expenses, but implicates a sensitivity to small perturbations. A variety of bounded orbits can be determined around each libration point and station-keeping is required to maintain them for multiple revolutions. In this paper, a station-keeping algorithm based on the orbital lifetime expectancy is proposed for so-called quasi-periodic solutions. The method introduced is based on the identification of a manoeuvre maximising the lifetime of an orbit within defined boundaries. The manoeuvre direction and magnitude is finally optimised with a differential evolution algorithm. The novelty of the method presented here is the identification of the downstream centre manifold by the lifetime analysis to preserve the orbit with its properties forward in time. The study shows that the manoeuvre direction is directly correlated to stability information that is provided by the Floquet modal theory. Finally, numerical calculations were carried out for trajectories around the far-side libration point in the Earth-Moon system to show the effectiveness of this station-keeping approach. The robustness is proven by the introduction of errors and the evaluation of their impact.",I & J,913

This unique feature has been exploited in recent studies for the active control of the flow instability. The use of forced coaxial gas streams has been proposed as a way to stabilize the Marangoni convection in liquid bridges in the planned space experiment JEREMI (Japanese and European Research Experiment on Marangoni Instabilities). It is aimed at understanding the mechanism of the instability and the role of the surface heat transfer and surface shear stresses.

B,Modelling the impact of temperature-induced life history plasticity and mate limitation on the epidemic potential of a marine ectoparasite,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/modelling-the-impact-of-temperature-induced-life-history-plastici,"Temperature is hypothesized to contribute to increased pathogenicity and virulence of many marine diseases. The sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) is an ectoparasite of salmonids that exhibits strong life-history plasticity in response to temperature; however, the effect of temperature on the epidemiology of this parasite has not been rigorously examined. We used matrix population modelling to examine the influence of temperature on demographic parameters of sea lice parasitizing farmed salmon. Demographically-stochastic population projection matrices were created using parameters from the existing literature on vital rates of sea lice at different fixed temperatures and yearly temperature profiles. In addition, we quantified the effectiveness of a single stage-specific control applied at different times during a year with seasonal temperature changes. We found that the epidemic potential of sea lice increased with temperature due to a decrease in generation time and an increase in the net reproductive rate. In addition, mate limitation constrained population growth more at low temperatures than at high temperatures. Our model predicts that control measures targeting preadults and chalimus are most effective regardless of the temperature. The predictions from this model suggest that temperature can dramatically change vital rates of sea lice and can increase population growth. The results of this study suggest that sea surface temperatures should be considered when choosing salmon farm sites and designing management plans to control sea louse infestations. More broadly, this study demonstrates the utility of matrix population modelling for epidemiological studies.",M & A,160

A,Self-truncated ionization injection and consequent monoenergetic electron bunches in laser wakefield acceleration,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/self-truncated-ionization-injection-and-consequent-monoenergetic-,"The ionization-induced injection in laser wakefield acceleration has been recently demonstrated to be a promising injection scheme. However, the energy spread controlling in this mechanism remains a challenge because continuous injection in a mixed gas target is usually inevitable. Here, we propose that by use of certain initially unmatched laser pulses, the electron injection can be constrained to the very front region of the mixed gas target, typically in a length of a few hundreds micrometers determined by the laser self-focusing and the wake deformation. As a result, the produced electron beam has narrow energy spread and meanwhile contains tens of pC in charge. Both multidimensional simulations and theoretical analysis illustrate the effectiveness of this scheme.",B & C & D,397

With waterproof monitors intended to be worn 24 hours per day, and companion smartphone applications able to offer analysis and sharing of activity data, we investigate and compare the privacy policies of four services, and the extent to which these services protect user privacy, as we find these services do not fall within the scope of existing legislation regarding the privacy of health data. We then present a set of criteria which would preserve user privacy, and avoid the concerns identified within the policies of the services investigated.",E & F,572
C,High-temperature rapid devolatilization of biomasses with varying degrees of torrefaction,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/high-temperature-rapid-devolatilization-of-biomasses-with-varying,"Torrefied biomass is a coal-like fuel that can be burned in biomass boilers or co-fired with coal in co-firing furnaces. To make quantitative predictions regarding combustion behavior, devolatilization should be accurately described. In this work, the devolatilization of three torrefied biomasses and their parent material were tested in an isothermal plug flow reactor, which is able to rapidly heat the biomass particles to a maximum temperature of 1400 ºC at a rate of 104 ºC/s, similar to the conditions in actual power plant furnaces. During every devolatilization test, the devolatilized biomass particles were collected and analyzed to determine the weight loss based on the ash tracer method. According to the experimental results, it can be concluded that biomass decreases its reactivity after torrefaction, and the deeper of torrefaction conducted, the lower the biomass reactivity. Furthermore, based on a two-competing-step model, the kinetic parameters were determined by minimizing the difference between the modeled and experimental results based on the least-squares objective function, and the predicted weight losses exhibited a good agreement with experimental data from biomass devolatilization, especially at high temperatures. It was also detected that CO and H2 are the primary components of the released volatile matters from the devolatilization of the three torrefied biomasses, in which CO accounts for approximately 45-60%, and H2 accounts for 20-30% of the total volatile species.",H & J,671
C,Comparative genomics of isolates of a pseudomonas aeruginosa epidemic strain associated with chronic lung infections of cystic fibrosis patients,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/comparative-genomics-of-isolates-of-a-pseudomonas-aeruginosa-epid,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the main cause of fatal chronic lung infections among individuals suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). During the past 15 years, particularly aggressive strains transmitted among CF patients have been identified, initially in Europe and more recently in Canada. The aim of this study was to generate high-quality genome sequences for 7 isolates of the Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) from the United Kingdom and Canada representing different virulence characteristics in order to: (1) associate comparative genomics results with virulence factor variability and (2) identify genomic and/or phenotypic divergence between the two geographical locations. We performed phenotypic characterization of pyoverdine, pyocyanin, motility, biofilm formation, and proteolytic activity. We also assessed the degree of virulence using the Dictyostelium discoideum amoeba model. Comparative genomics analysis revealed at least one large deletion (40-50 kb) in 6 out of the 7 isolates compared to the reference genome of LESB58. These deletions correspond to prophages, which are known to increase the competitiveness of LESB58 in chronic lung infection. We also identified 308 non-synonymous polymorphisms, of which 28 were associated with virulence determinants and 52 with regulatory proteins. At the phenotypic level, isolates showed extensive variability in production of pyocyanin, pyoverdine, proteases and biofilm as well as in swimming motility, while being predominantly avirulent in the amoeba model. Isolates from the two continents were phylogenetically and phenotypically undistinguishable. Most regulatory mutations were isolate-specific and 29% of them were predicted to have high functional impact. Therefore, polymorphism in regulatory genes is likely to be an important basis for phenotypic diversity among LES isolates, which in turn might contribute to this strain's adaptability to varying conditions in the CF lung.",L & K & C,166

In this paper a seeded growth method is presented, whereby varying the concentration of sodium borohydride-reduced silver nanoparticle seeds, different sizes of stable spherical nanoparticles with a low polydispersity nanoparticles are produced using hydroquinone as a selective reducing agent. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) enhancement factor for each nanoparticle size produced (17, 26, 50, and 65 nm) was then assessed using three different analytes, rhodamine 6G (R6G), malachite green oxalate (MGO) and thiophenol (TP). The enhancement factor gives an indication of the Raman enhancement effect by the nanoparticle. Using non-aggregated conditions and two different laser excitation wavelength (633 nm and 785 nm) it is shown that an increase in particle size results in an increased enhancement for each analyte used.",A & D,674

A tendency to externalise and act-out when in emotional distress often masks the vulnerabilities of young men. This is compounded by the fact that young men are significantly less likely than young women to seek help for physical, emotional and other problems, leaving them open to prolonged suffering. This paper, written by CYCJ Research Fellow Nina Vaswani, explores some of the theories behind this gender gap in help-seeking and discusses the implications for practice and research.",E,594
B,Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws? Survey evidence from Brazil,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/who-blames-corruption-for-the-poor-enforcement-of-environmental-l,"Who blames corruption for the poor enforcement of environmental laws? The answer to this question is important since corruption is an important reason why environmental policies are not properly enforced, but previous studies of environmental public opinion do not address the issue. We analyze data from a survey fielded in Brazil in June 2012, immediately preceding the Rio+20 environmental summit. We test hypotheses on income, education, and perception of corruption as a cause of poor enforcement of environmental policy. We find that wealthy individuals are more likely to associate corruption with enforcement failure than their poorer counterparts. However, education is not associated with the belief that corruption is a primary cause of enforcement failure. These results suggest that since wealthy Brazilians have a higher exposure to corruption because of their interaction with government officials, they understand the role of corruption in policy failure. Conversely, the kind of general information that education offers does not raise concern about the role of corruption in environmental policy. The results have important implications particularly in democratic societies, where governments have stronger incentives to address the problem if the concerned public associates corruption with enforcement failure.",A,386

In this paper, we present findings from a qualitative study conducted with recently migrated Eastern European children and their parents, reporting on their experiences of accessing health services post-migration. Unlike the case of adults, the experiences of newly migrated children have rarely been explored in relation to health services. We pay particular attention to three key areas: (1) migrant families׳ views of health service provision; (2) barriers to health service use; and (3) transnational use of health services. By using a social capital approach, we show how concerns about the Scottish health care practices enacted by migrant parents are adopted by children and are likely to impact on families׳ health beliefs and behaviours. The study highlights the important role of migrants׳ active participation as users of health services. We conclude that appropriate health services need to consider more carefully migrants׳ expectations and complex health care activities, in order to be fully inclusive and patient-centred.",I & C & M,369

We do not assume that the positive measurement outcome operators are effects or that they form a probability operator measure. We derive a more general probability rule from which the standard rule can be obtained from the normal laws of probability when there is no measurement outcome information available, without the need for further quantum postulates. Our general probability rule has prediction-retrodiction symmetry and we show how it may be applied in quantum communications and in retrodictive quantum theory.",B & H,552

Near-field transmission spectra of a single nanodisc exhibited multiple plasmon resonances in the visible to near-infrared region. Near-field transmission images observed at these resonance wavelengths show wavy spatial features depending on the wavelength of observation. To clarify physical pictures of the images, theoretical simulations based on spatial correlation between electromagnetic fundamental modes inside and outside of the disc were performed. Simulated images reproduced the observed spatial structures excited in the disc. Mode-analysis of the simulated images indicates that the spatial features observed in the transmission images originate mainly from a few fundamental plasmon modes of the disc.",D & L,453

In order to address this issue, the Scottish Government commissioned the Family Therapy Training Network (FTTN) to provide systemic family therapy training to practitioners working in the youth justice sector across Scotland. The Family Therapy Training Network is a multi-disciplinary professional network and members are the only Scottish based providers of accredited, post-graduate professional training in family therapy and systemic practice.

C,Investigation of the shape transferability of nanoscale multi-tip diamond tools in the diamond turning of nanostructures,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/investigation-of-the-shape-transferability-of-nanoscale-multi-tip,"In this article, the shape transferability of using nanoscale multi-tip diamond tools in the diamond turning for scale-up manufacturing of nanostructures has been demonstrated. Atomistic multi-tip diamond tool models were built with different tool geometries in terms of the difference in the tip cross-sectional shape, tip angle, and the feature of tool tip configuration, to determine their effect on the applied forces and the machined nano-groove geometries. The quality of machined nanostructures was characterized by the thickness of the deformed layers and the dimensional accuracy achieved. Simulation results show that diamond turning using nanoscale multi-tip tools offers tremendous shape transferability in machining nanostructures. Both periodic and non-periodic nano-grooves with different cross-sectional shapes can be successfully fabricated using the multi-tip tools. A hypothesis of minimum designed ratio of tool tip distance to tip base width (L/Wf) of the nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool for the high precision machining of nanostructures was proposed based on the analytical study of the quality of the nanostructures fabricated using different types of the multi-tip tools. Nanometric cutting trials using nanoscale multi-tip diamond tools (different in L/Wf) fabricated by focused ion beam (FIB) were then conducted to verify the hypothesis. The investigations done in this work imply the potential of using the nanoscale multi-tip diamond tool for the deterministic fabrication of period and non-periodic nanostructures, which opens up the feasibility of using the process as a versatile manufacturing technique in nanotechnology.",D,924

Thus, now-casts, which are estimates of current values of macroeconomic variables, are becoming increasingly popular. This paper takes up the challenge of nowcasting Scottish GDP growth. Nowcasting in Scotland, currently a government office region within the United Kingdom, is complicated due to data limitations. For instance, key nowcast predictors such as industrial production are unavailable. Accordingly, we use data on some non-traditional variables and investigate whether UK aggregates can help nowcast Scottish GDP growth. Such data limitations are shared by many other sub-national regions, so we hope this paper can provide lessons for other regions interested in developing nowcasting models.",C,158
E,Cost-benefit analysis of epidemics spreading on clustered random networks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cost-benefit-analysis-of-epidemics-spreading-on-clustered-random-,"We study, control of infectious disease epidemics spreading on random networks with different levels of clustering. We use Gleeson's et al., Phys. Rev. E80, 036107 (2009) algorithm to create clustered networks in which a proportion of individuals is located in fully-connected cliques of certain size. A SIR model is extended to include delayed and imperfect detection of infectious individuals. We also include a combination of responsive (palliative) and preventive (vaccination) treatments and design cost-effective disease control strategies. Cost-benefit analysis is used in combination with epidemiological simulations to identify an optimal radius for a treatment centred upon the symptomatic individual. Three general control strategies occur depending on the relative cost of treatment and prevention. Network topology and, in particular, clustering also affects the applicability of the control strategy. The average path length appears to be more important; the range for the control strategy is wider with the length, but the optimal radius of control also extends. As the proportion of individuals in cliques and therefore the coefficient of clustering is higher, the range of the costs for which control scenario is optimal is greater. This results have important consequences for designing disease control strategies that also satisfy economic optimality criteria.",B & E,518

D,Solving the Boltzmann equation deterministically by the fast spectral method: application to gas microflows,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/solving-the-boltzmann-equation-deterministically-by-the-fast-spec,"Based on the fast spectral approximation to the Boltzmann collision operator, we present an accurate and efficient deterministic numerical method for solving the Boltzmann equation. First, the linearised Boltzmann equation is solved for Poiseuille and thermal creep flows, where the influence of different molecular models on the mass and heat flow rates is assessed, and the Onsager-Casimir relation at the microscopic level for large Knudsen numbers is demonstrated. Recent experimental measurements of mass flow rates along a rectangular tube with large aspect ratio are compared with numerical results for the linearised Boltzmann equation. Then, a number of two-dimensional micro flows in the transition and free molecular flow regimes are simulated using the nonlinear Boltzmann equation. The influence of the molecular model is discussed, as well as the applicability of the linearised Boltzmann equation. For thermally driven flows in the free molecular regime, it is found that the magnitudes of the flow velocity are inversely proportional to the Knudsen number. The streamline patterns of thermal creep flow inside a closed
rectangular channel are analysed in detail: when the Knudsen number is smaller than a critical value, the flow pattern can be predicted based on a linear superposition of the velocity profiles of linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep 
flows between parallel plates. For large Knudsen numbers, the flow pattern can be determined using the linearised Poiseuille and thermal creep velocity profiles at the critical Knudsen number. The critical Knudsen number is found to be related to the aspect ratio of the rectangular channel.",F & K,298

With this paper we try to address this gap by studying and comparing, through classic methods of mathematical statistics, morphological features of five London gentrified neighbourhoods. Outcomes confirm that areas which have undergone gentrification display similar and recognizable morphological patterns in terms of urban type and geographical location of main and local roads as well as businesses. These initial results confirm findings from previous research in urban sociology, and highlight the role of urban form in contributing to shape dynamics of non-spatial nature in cities.",B & L,414
C,Effects of aggregate densification upon thickening of Kynchian suspensions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effects-of-aggregate-densification-upon-thickening-of-kynchian-su,"A model is presented for the thickening of a raked suspension. The model is based on Kynch theory (Kynch, 1952), i.e. it describes systems with solids fractions sufficiently low that the solids have not gelled into a weight-bearing network. However the model incorporates a modification to describe how raking the suspension causes flocs or aggregates within it to densify. This floc densification opens up channels between the flocs through which liquid escapes, making the suspension easier to dewater. The densification theory presented here predicts profiles of varying solids fraction vs height in the settling zone in a thickener, information which is not normally available when designing thickeners via the conventional Kynch theory. Performance enhancements for thickeners due to raking can be readily determined, either in terms of increased underflow solids fraction or increased solids flux. As underflow solids fraction is increased, thickeners operated at a specified aggregate densification rate (or equivalently at a fixed settling zone height) tend to approach a 'fully densified' suspension state (defined as a point at which the extent of aggregate densification ceases to change with time), with improved thickening performance.",E & A,573
C,Turboelectric distributed propulsion protection system design trades,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/turboelectric-distributed-propulsion-protection-system-design-tra,"The NASA N3-X blended-wing body with turboelectric distributed propulsion concept is being studied to achieve N+3 goals such as reduced noise, emissions, and improved energy efficiency.  The electrical distribution system is cryogenic in order to maximize its efficiency and increase the power density of all associated components, while the motors, generators, and transmission lines are superconducting.  The protection of a superconducting DC network poses unique electrical and thermal challenges due to the low impedance of the superconductor and operation in the superconducting or quenched states.  For a given TeDP electrical system architecture with fixed power ratings, conventional and solid-state circuit breakers combined with superconducting fault-current limiters are examined with both voltage and current source control to limit and interrupt the fault current.  To estimate the protection system weight and losses, scalable models of cryogenic bidirectional current-source converters, cryogenic bidirectional IGBT solid-state circuit breakers, and resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters are developed to assess how the weight and losses of these components vary as a function of nominal voltage and current and fault current ratings. The scalable models are used to assess the protection system weight for several trade-offs.  System studies include the trade-off in fault-current limiting capability of SFCL on CB mass, alongside the fault-current limiting capability of the converter and its impact on CB fault-current interruption ratings and weight.",A & G,179
D,Concepts for a geostationary-like polar missions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/concepts-for-a-geostationary-like-polar-missions,"An evidence-led scientific case for development of a space-based polar remote sensing platform at geostationary-like (GEO-like) altitudes is developed through methods including a data user survey. Whilst a GEO platform provides a near static perspective, multiple platforms are required to provide circumferential coverage. Systems for achieving GEO-like polar observation likewise require multiple platforms however the perspective is non-stationery. A key choice is between designs that provide complete polar view from a single platform at any given instant, and designs where this is obtained by compositing partial views from multiple sensors. Users foresee an increased challenge in extracting geophysical information from composite images and consider the use of non-composited images advantageous. Users also find the placement of apogee over the pole to be preferable to the alternative scenarios. Thus, a clear majority of data users find the “Taranis” orbit concept to be better than a critical inclination orbit, due to the improved perspective offered. The geophysical products that would benefit from a GEO-like polar platform are mainly estimated from radiances in the visible/near infrared and thermal parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is consistent with currently proven technologies from GEO. Based on the survey results, needs analysis, and current technology proven from GEO, scientific and observation requirements are developed along with two instrument concepts with eight and four channels, based on Flexible Combined Imager heritage. It is found that an operational system could, mostly likely, be deployed from an Ariane 5 ES to a 16-hour orbit, while a proof-of-concept system could be deployed from a Soyuz launch to the
same orbit.",H & L,701
E,Organising in the air and on the ground - cabin crew resistance to British Airways: Reconfiguration of work and employment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/organising-in-the-air-and-on-the-ground-cabin-crew-resistance-to-,"The focus is on the protracted dispute (2009 - 2011) between British Airways (BA) and its cabin crew and their union BASSA (British Airlines’ Stewards and Stewardesses Association). Against a historical legacy of adversarial employment relations, the dispute was triggered by the company’s imposition, in disregard of collective bargaining procedures, of reduced crewing levels, transformed working arrangements and a new ‘mixed fleet’ on inferior terms and conditions. Despite the fact that the company marshalled considerable resou rces against the union, including a ‘strategy of decapitation’ of the BASSA leadership, the cabin demonstrated a profound commitment to collective action that saw very large ballot majorities and 22 days of strike action. The question driving the paper is how to explain such powerful collectivism given the adverse conditions facing the crew. Specifically, the paper is concerned with how BASSA was able to organise when confronted with a number of spatial problematics, including the residential disaggregation of it crews and the dispersal across the globe of a transient workforce. Drawing on testimony deriving from extended in-depth semi-structured interviews, the paper provides compelling evidence of BASSA’s and crews’ utilisation of internet-based communication to organise members and to help overcome the problems of dispersion and distance. Particular emphasis is placed on the effectiveness of the BASSA Forum and Crew Forum. The paper engages with a recent literature on union use of internet-based communication and social media and both challenges those who have exaggerated the importance of their capacity to generate a ‘distributed discourse’ and those who have been overly-sceptical of unions’ ability to effectively use such technologies. In the BA-BASSA dispute of 2009 - 2011 virtual forms of organising were integrated with the real, although in the final analysis mass meetings, and rallies and effective picketing were the fulcrum of action on strike days. Internet-based communication and interaction certainly contributed to successful organising but of most import for collectivism was BASSA’s embeddedness in the work lives of their members.",D,372

A,Incremental planning of multi-gravity assist trajectories,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/incremental-planning-of-multi-gravity-assist-trajectories-2,"The paper presents a novel algorithm for the automatic planning and scheduling of multi-gravity assist trajectories (MGA). The algorithm translates the design of an MGA transfer into a planning and scheduling process in which each planetary encounter is seen as a scheduled task. All possible transfers form a directional graph that is incrementally built and explored simultaneously forward from the departure planet to the arrival one and backward from the arrival planet to the departure one. Nodes in the graph (or tree) represent tasks (or planetary encounters). Backward and forward generated transfers are then matched during the construction of the tree to improve both convergence and exploration. It can be shown, in fact, that the multi-directional exploration of the tree, allows for better quality solutions for the same computational cost. Unlike branch and prune algorithms that use a set of deterministic branching and pruning heuristics, the algorithm proposed in this paper progressively builds a probabilistic model over all the possible tasks that form a complete trajectory. No branch is pruned but the probability of selecting one particular task increases as the algorithm progresses in the search for a solution. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on the design optimization of the trajectory of Marco Polo, JUICE and MESSENGER missions.",E & F,250

B,Fully resolved simulation of particle deposition and heat transfer in a differentially heated cavity,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/fully-resolved-simulation-of-particle-deposition-and-heat-transfe,"In this paper a fictitious domain method is used to study the motion of particles in a differentially heated cavity. A collision strategy is implemented which is validated using the problem of two freely falling particles with natural convection taking place from the leading hot particle. The motion of the particles in a differentially heated cavity is considered where the vertical walls are subject to a temperature difference δ. T whereas horizontal walls are assumed to be adiabatic. Depending on the fluid Grashof number different flow regimes and two critical Grashof numbers are identified. Sustained motion of the suspended particles is also studied and different behaviour is observed compared to the limiting case of tracer particles where simulations are usually performed using one-way coupled point-particle assumptions. Finally the effects of the particles on the heat transfer from the hot wall are studied and it is found that addition of large particles can adversely influence the heat transfer rate. However, if hot particles are effectively removed from the wall, e.g. by increasing the Grashof number, wall heat transfer properties can still be enhanced.",M & I,789
B,Factors affecting the performance of the Zn-Ce redox flow battery,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/factors-affecting-the-performance-of-the-zn-ce-redox-flow-battery,"The Hull Cell was used to investigate the impact of current density j on the morphology and uniformity of zinc electrodeposited from a 2.5 mol dm−3 Zn2+ solution in 1.5 mol dm−3 methanesulfonic acid at 40◦C onto carbon-composite surfaces. The range of the applied deposition current density used was between1 mA cm−2 and 100 mA cm−2. Good, robust deposits were obtained when j ≥ 10 mA cm2 whereas at j’s lower than this, patchy films formed due to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on the bare carbon-composite surface. An understanding of these effects and its application in the redox flow battery enabled both the coulombic and cell potential efficiencies to be maintained at relatively high values, 90% and 69% respectively, indicating a successful inhibition of the HER on the fully formed Zn layer. Flow velocity at the low Reynolds number in the cell (Re <200) had little impact on the electrochemical cell performance. Depletion of the cerium species became an issue for long charge times.",B & L,508
C,Quantification of functionalised gold nanoparticle-targeted knockdown of gene expression in HeLa cells,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantification-of-functionalised-gold-nanoparticle-targeted-knock,"Introduction: Gene therapy continues to grow as an important area of research, primarily because of its potential in the treatment of disease. One significant area where there is a need for better understanding is in improving the efficiency of oligonucleotide delivery to the cell and indeed, following delivery, the characterization of the effects on the cell. Methods: In this report, we compare different transfection reagents as delivery vehicles for gold nanoparticles functionalized with DNA oligonucleotides, and quantify their relative transfection efficiencies. The inhibitory properties of small interfering RNA (siRNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) sequences targeted to human metallothionein hMT-IIa are also quantified in HeLa cells. Techniques used in this study include fluorescence and confocal microscopy, qPCR and Western analysis. Findings: We show that the use of transfection reagents does significantly increase nanoparticle transfection efficiencies. Furthermore, siRNA, ssRNA and ssDNA sequences all have comparable inhibitory properties to ssDNA sequences immobilized onto gold nanoparticles. We also show that functionalized gold nanoparticles can co-localize with autophagosomes and illustrate other factors that can affect data collection and interpretation when performing studies with functionalized nanoparticles. Conclusions: The desired outcome for biological knockdown studies is the efficient reduction of a specific target; which we demonstrate by using ssDNA inhibitory sequences targeted to human metallothionein IIa gene transcripts that result in the knockdown of both the mRNA transcript and the target protein.",E & A,812

D,Characterisation of triterpenes and new phenolic lipids in Cameroonian propolis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/characterisation-of-triterpenes-and-new-phenolic-lipids-in-camero,"Chemical investigation of a sample of propolis originating from North-Western Cameroon led to the isolation of thirteen alk(en)ylphenols (1-13) (inseparable mixture) along with α-amyrin (14), β-amyrin (15), lupeol (16), cycloartenol (17), mangiferonic acid (18), ambonic acid (19), mangiferolic acid (20), ambolic acid (21), isomangiferolic acid (22) and nine alk(en)ylresorcinols (23-31) (inseparable mixture). All compounds were identified following analysis of their spectroscopic data and comparison with previously published reports. Compounds (8), (12), (13) and (30) are new natural products. GC-MS analysis carried out on the alk(en)ylphenol and alk(en)ylresorcinol mixtures (dimethyl disulphide trimethylsilyl derivatives) revealed the presence of saturated and mono-unsaturated compounds with side chain lengths ranging from C11 to C19 and C15 to C19, respectively. The position of the double bond in mono-unsaturated derivatives was established from the characteristic fragments resulting from the cleavage of the bond between the two methylthio-substituted carbons. The most abundant compound in each mixture was 3-(12′Z-heptadecenyl)-phenol (10) and 5-(12′Z-heptadecenyl)- resorcinol (29).

E,High-mode spoof SPP of periodic metal grooves for ultra-sensitive terahertz sensing,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/high-mode-spoof-spp-of-periodic-metal-grooves-for-ultra-sensitive,"We report terahertz surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing based on prism-coupling to the spoof surface plasmon polariton (SSPP) mode existing on periodically grooved metal films. It was demonstrated that, except for the fundamental mode of the SSPP, there was also a higher mode SSPP wave when the depth of groove was larger. Both fundamental and high-order modes of SSPP could be used for terahertz sensing. We compared the performance of different modes of SSPP on the sensing sensitivity using both reflection amplitude and phase-jump information. The results indicated that the gap distance between the prism base and the metal film had a significant influence on the reflectivity of SPR sensing by affecting the coupling efficiency of an evanescent wave to an SSPP wave; also, high-order mode SSPP-based sensing had a high sensitivity of up to 2.27 THz/RIU, which nearly doubled the sensitivity of the fundamental mode. The application of high-mode SSPP has enormous potential for ultra-sensitive SPR sensing in the terahertz regime.",B & E,199

The researchers focused on eight different types of e-mail, such as calls for papers, newsletters and spam, which were chosen to represent different genres. The study involved the collection of oculographic behavior data based on the scanpath duration and scanpath length based metric, to highlight the ways in which people view the features of genres. We found that genre analysis based on purpose and form (layout features, etc.) was an effective means of identifying the characteristics of these e-mails.

In such problems a common goal is achieving a desired balance in the allocation over different categories of the entities. We propose a bi-criteria framework for trading balance off against efficiency. We define and categorise indicators based on balance distribution and propose formulations and solution algorithms which provide insight into the balance-efficiency tradeoff.

C,Two critical issues in Langevin simulation of gas flows,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/two-critical-issues-in-langevin-simulation-of-gas-flows-2,"A stochastic algorithm based on the Langevin equation has been recently proposed to simulate rarefied gas flows. Compared with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, the Langevin method is more efficient in simulating small Knudsen number flows. While it is well-known that the cell sizes and time steps should be smaller than the mean free path and the mean collision time, respectively, in DSMC simulations, the Langevin equation uses a drift term and a diffusion term to describe molecule movements, so no direct molecular collisions have to be modeled. This enables the Langevin simulation to proceed with a much larger time step than that in the DSMC method. Two critical issues in Langevin simulation are addressed in this paper. The first issue is how to reproduce the transport properties as that described by kinetic theory. Transport coefficients predicted by Langevin equation are obtained by using Green-Kubo formulae. The second issue is numerical scheme with boundary conditions. We present two schemes corresponding to small time step and large time step, respectively. For small time step, the scheme is similar to DSMC method as the update of positions and velocities are uncoupled; for large time step, we present an analytical solution of the hitting time, which is the crucial factor for accurate simulation. Velocity-Couette flow, thermal-Couette flow, Rayleigh-Bénard flow and wall-confined problem are simulated by using these two schemes. Our study shows that Langevin simulation is a promising tool to investigate small Knudsen number flows.",M & I,442

A,Applications of omics approaches to the development of microbiological risk assessment using RNA virus dose–response models as a case study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/applications-of-omics-approaches-to-the-development-of-microbiolo,"The last decade has seen a huge increase in the amount of “omics” data available and in our ability to interpret those data. The aim of this paper is to consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents prediction of risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more broad predictions to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made.",E & A,236

C,Investigating the use of record-to-record variability in static capacity approaches,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/investigating-the-use-of-record-to-record-variability-in-static-c,"In performance-based earthquake engineering, fragility curves constitute an essential component, providing a probabilistic link between the earthquake intensity measure and the structural response, expressed as an engineering demand parameter. In this study, we apply a capacity spectrum method that uses inelastic response spectra derived from earthquake accelerograms to construct fragility curves for an example reinforced concrete structure. This approach has the advantage of simplicity and rapidity over methods using the accelerograms directly. Various sets of scaled and unscaled accelerograms are used to investigate the impact of record-to-record variability on the derived curves. It is found that the variability in the input spectra at periods longer than the natural period of the undamaged structure has a direct impact on the standard deviation associated with the curves. When the spectra closely match a target, the curves are almost vertical (small standard deviations); but, as the variation around the target increases ,the curves become flatter (high standard deviations). A variant of the peak-to-trough measure introduced by Stafford and Bommer (2010) provides a useful way of measuring the variability in the input spectra.",H & L,620
D,"'Right Back Where We Started From': From 'the Classics' to Keynes, and Back Again",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/right-back-where-we-started-from-from-the-classics-to-keynes-and-,"The purpose of this paper is to highlight the curiously circular course followed by mainstream macroeconomic thinking in recent times. Having broken from classical orthodoxy in the late 1930s via Keynes’s General Theory, over the last three or four decades the mainstream conventional wisdom, regressing rather than progressing, has now come to embrace a conception of the working of the macroeconomy which is again of a classical, essentially pre-Keynesian, character. At the core of the analysis presented in the typical contemporary macro textbook is the (neo)classical model of the labour market, which represents employment as determined (given conditions of productivity) by the terms of labour supply. While it is allowed that changes in aggregate demand may temporarily affect output and employment, the contention is that in due course employment will automatically return to its ‘natural’ (full employment) level. Unemployment is therefore identified as a merely frictional or voluntary phenomenon: involuntary unemployment - in other words persisting demand-deficient unemployment - is entirely absent from the picture. Variations in aggregate demand are understood to have a lasting impact only on the price level, not on output and employment. This in effect amounts to a return to a Pigouvian conception such as targeted by Keynes in the General Theory. We take the view that this reversion to ideas which should by now be obsolete reflects not the discovery of logical or empirical deficiencies in the Keynes analysis, but results rather from doctrinaire blindness and failure of scholarship on account of which essential features of the Keynes theory have been overlooked or misrepresented. There is an urgent need for a critical appraisal of the current conventional macroeconomic wisdom.",D,463
A,Influence of stress on optical transitions in GaN nanorods containing a single InGaN/GaN quantum disk,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/influence-of-stress-on-optical-transitions-in-gan-nanorods-contai,Cathodoluminescence (CL) hyperspectral imaging has been performed on GaN nanorods containing a single InGaN quantum disk (SQD) with controlled variations in excitation conditions. Two different nanorod diameters (200 and 280 nm) have been considered.  Systematic changes in the CL spectra from the SQD were observed as the accelerating voltage of the electron beam and its position of incidence are varied.   It is shown that the dominant optical transition in the SQD varies across the nanorod as a result of interplay between the contributions of the deformation potential and the quantum-confined Stark effect to the transition energy as consequence of radial variation in the pseudomorphic strain.,C,734

Its intentions for the mathematics curriculum are similar to those in many countries: that learners be sufficiently mathematically literate to use mathematics in the personal, professional and societal dimensions of their lives. But like many attempts to reform mathematical curricula elsewhere, CfE does not address the fundamental issue of mathematical understanding. Of course, learner understanding transcends the mathematical curriculum per se, but the significance of mathematical understanding for competent functioning exemplifies the imperative of teaching for understanding or 'deep learning'. The essay begins with some conceptual 'ground clearing' to establish mathematical understanding as a neglected issue.  It then considers what mathematical understanding is, why it is important, the increasingly important role of metacognition, and the very necessary role of teachers. At each of these points, implications for pedagogical practice are raised.",B & E,298

Aim: To review the antimicrobial properties of 405 nm light and to describe its application as an environmental decontamination technology with particular reference to disinfection of the hospital environment.

Methods: Extensive literature searches for relevant scientific papers and reports.

Findings: A large body of scientific evidence is now available that provides underpinning knowledge of the 405 nm light-induced photodynamic inactivation process involved in the destruction of a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial species, including resistant forms such as bacterial and fungal spores. For practical application, a high-intensity narrow-spectrum light environmental disinfection system (HINS-light EDS) has been developed and tested in hospital isolation rooms. The trial results have demonstrated that this 405 nm light system can provide continuous disinfection of air and exposed surfaces in occupied areas of the hospital, thereby substantially enhancing standard cleaning and infection control procedures.

Conclusion: Violet–blue light, particularly 405 nm light, has significant antimicrobial properties against a wide range of bacterial and fungal pathogens and, although germicidal efficacy is lower than UV light, this limitation is offset by its facility for safe, continuous use in occupied environments. Promising results on disinfection efficacy have been obtained in hospital trials but the full impact of this technology on reduction of healthcare-associated infection has yet to be determined.",F & K,603

Our construction is also applied to the simplest realization of the quantum link models or gauge magnets and provides a clear way to understand their microscopic relation with the Kogut- Susskind lattice gauge theories. We also introduce a new set of gauge-invariant operators that modify continuously Rokhsar-Kivelson wave functions and can be used to extend the phase diagrams of known models. As an example, we characterize the transition between the deconfined phase of the Z2 lattice gauge theory and the Rokhsar-Kivelson point of the U(1) gauge magnet in 2D in terms of entanglement entropy.  he topological entropy serves as an order parameter for the transition but not the Schmidt gap.",B & L,932

D,"From parametricity to conservation laws, via Noether's Theorem",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/from-parametricity-to-conservation-laws-via-noethers-theorem,"Invariance is of paramount importance in programming languages and in physics. In programming languages, John Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity demonstrates that parametric polymorphic programs are invariant under change of data representation, a property that yields ""free"" theorems about programs just from their types. In physics, Emmy Noether showed that if the action of a physical system is invariant under change of coordinates, then the physical system has a conserved quantity: a quantity that remains constant for all time. Knowledge of conserved quantities can reveal deep properties of physical systems. For example, the conservation of energy is by Noether's theorem a consequence of a system's invariance under time-shifting.

In this paper, we link Reynolds' relational parametricity with Noether's theorem for deriving conserved quantities. We propose an extension of System Fω with new kinds, types and term constants for writing programs that describe classical mechanical systems in terms of their Lagrangians. We show, by constructing a relationally parametric model of our extension of Fω, that relational parametricity is enough to satisfy the hypotheses of Noether's theorem, and so to derive conserved quantities for free, directly from the polymorphic types of Lagrangians expressed in our system.",H & L,361

We report on characterizing electron bunches where double bunches are observed under certain conditions. In particular, we present pepper-pot measurements of the transverse emittance of 120-200 MeV laser wakefield electron bunches after propagation through a triplet of permanent quadrupole magnets. It is shown that the normalized emittance at source can be as low as 1 π mm mrad (resolution limited), growing by about five times after propagation through the quadrupoles due to beam energy spread. The inherent energy-dependence of the magnets also enables detection of double electron bunches that could otherwise remain unresolved, providing insight into the self-injection of multiple bunches.

E,Phase current reconstruction of switched reluctance motors from DC-link current under double high frequency pulses injection,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/phase-current-reconstruction-of-switched-reluctance-motors-from-d,"witched reluctance motors (SRMs) have been considered as low-cost machines for electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) applications. However, the current sensors used in the system will not only increase the cost and volume, but also degrade the running reliability of the motor drives. Conventionally, the current sensors are used in each phase winding individually to obtain these phase currents. To reduce the number of current sensors, a four-phase 8/6-pole SRM is applied to analyze the working states and a novel phase current reconstruction method from the dc-link current employing double high frequency pulses injection is then proposed. Two kinds of high frequency pulses with large duty-cycles and phase-shift are injected to the down-switches in each phase respectively when the phase currents are overlapped in the turn-on region, and the dc-link current is decomposed to reconstruct phase currents in both current chopping control (CCC) system and single pulse control (SPC) system. The transient performance in a closed-loop system based on the phase current reconstruction scheme is investigated. The proposed method uses only one current sensor in the dc-link and requires no additional circuits. The simulation and experimental results are presented to confirm the implementation of the proposed method.",B & L,285
A,Generating controllable velocity fluctuations using twin oscillating hydrofoils: experimental validation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/generating-controllable-velocity-fluctuations-using-twin-oscillat-2,"A method for generating controllable two-dimensional velocity fluctuations using two pitching foils was derived theoretically in a previous companion paper. The present work describes the experimental implementation of the method. The experiments are carried out in a re-circulating water channel optimised to provide low turbulence intensity in the incoming flow. Velocities are measured using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter (ADV). The pitching motions of the foils are position-controlled using a closed-loop control system. Two velocity fluctuation patterns are investigated. They consist of a combination of sinusoidal components. Theoretical predictions and experimental measurements are compared in the time and frequency domain. Although some discrepancies are observed, the agreement is generally good and therefore validates the theoretical method for the conditions investigated.",E & A,910
B,Size-tuneable nanometric MRI contrast agents for the imaging of molecular weight dependent transport processes,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/size-tuneable-nanometric-mri-contrast-agents-for-the-imaging-of-m,"The purpose of the current study was to evaluate size-tuneable polymeric glycol-chitosan (GC)-DTPAGadolinium (Gd) conjugates as MRI contrast agents that can be used as a platform for imaging of molecular weight (MW) dependent transport processes. GC-DTPA-Gd conjugates of precisely controlled MWs were synthesised and evaluated in mice against Gd-DTPA using time series of high-resolution MRI images of trunk, head, and xenograft flank tumours. GC-DTPA modification ratio was one DTPA per 3.9-5.13 of GC monomers. GC-DTAP-Gd provided overall superior contrast compared to Gd-DTPA with the duration of the enhancement depending on MW (≥1hr for 40kD). The kidneys showed early enhancement also, particularly in the renal pelvis, suggesting renal elimination. Imaging of the head with GC-DTPA-Gd allowed detailed anatomical identification of specific blood vessels in particular with the high MW CA agent. Sequential, high-resolution, isotropic imaging of established A431 xenograft flank tumours with DTPA-Gd and GC-DTPA-Gd demonstrated that the initial distribution of the contrast agents was well correlated with blood vessels and supply. In contrast, subsequent tissue transport was primarily by diffusion and limited by CA molecular weight. The data also highlight the role of heterogeneity in CA distribution which was more prominent for the high MW agent. Precise control of glycol chitosan (GC) polymer chemistry facilitates synthesis of a family of Gd-based MRI contrast agents of tuneable MW but otherwise identical physicochemical properties. Such agents allow isotropic high-resolution threedimensional imaging of MW dependent transport processes relevant to the clinical and pre-clinical prediction of drug transport processes.",A & G,474
C,The Known Unknowns of Governance,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-known-unknowns-of-governance-2,"Empirical researchers interested in how governance shapes various aspects of economic development frequently use the Worldwide Governance indicators (WGI). These variables come in the form of an estimate along with a standard error reflecting the uncertainty of this estimate. Existing empirical work simply uses the estimates as an explanatory variable and discards the information provided by the standard errors. In this paper, we argue that the appropriate practice should be to take into account the uncertainty around the WGI estimates through the use of multiple imputation. We investigate the importance of our proposed approach by revisiting in three applications the results of recently published studies. These applications cover the impact of governance on (i) capital flows; (ii) international trade; (iii) income levels around the world. We generally find that the estimated effects of governance are highly sensitive to the use of multiple imputation. We also show that model misspecification is a concern for the results of our reference studies. We conclude that the effects of governance are hard to establish once we take into account uncertainty around both the WGI estimates and the correct model specification.",H & L,397
D,Therapeutic efficacy of intravenously administered transferrin-conjugated dendriplexes on prostate carcinomas,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/therapeutic-efficacy-of-intravenously-administered-transferrin-co,"Aim: Improved treatments for prostate cancer are critically needed in order to overcome metastasis and lethal recurrence. Intravenously administered gene therapy would be an attractive anticancer treatment strategy; however, the lack of suitable carrier systems able to selectively deliver therapeutic genes to tumors has so far limited this investigation. Given that transferrin receptors are overexpressed on prostate cancer cells, the purpose of this study is to determine whether transferrin-conjugated dendriplexes encoding TNF-α, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and IL-12 would suppress the growth of prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Materials & methods: Transferrin-conjugated dendriplexes encoding TNF-α, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and IL-12 were intravenously administered to mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 and DU145 tumors. Results: The administration of the transferrin-conjugated generation 3 diaminobutyric polypropylenimine dendriplex encoding TNF-α resulted in tumor suppression for 60% of PC-3 and 50% of DU145 prostate tumors. Conclusion: These dendriplexes hold great potential as a novel approach for prostate cancer therapy.",D,777
A,Wear maps for TiC composite based coatings deposited on 303 stainless steel,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/wear-maps-for-tic-composite-based-coatings-deposited-on-303-stain,"Dry sliding wear (pin-on-disc) tests were carried out under ambient conditions at room temperature for TiC coated and uncoated 303 stainless steel, using alumina as a counterface. The composite coating which was developed by Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) methods increased the surface hardness of the substrate and the sliding wear resistance of the substrate. Wear maps for both uncoated and coated materials were developed on the basis of tests results. The results indicated that the role of oxidative wear differed significantly for both coated and uncoated materials on the wear map.  In addition, it was found that TiC composite coatings not only increased the wear resistance but also expanded the mild wear region towards higher loads and sliding speeds.",C,603
E,Investigation on the thermal effects during nanometric cutting process while using nanoscale diamond tools,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/investigation-on-the-thermal-effects-during-nanometric-cutting-pr,"In this paper, large scale molecular dynamics simulations are carried out to investigate the thermal effect on nanometric cutting of copper while using a single tip and a multi-tip nanoscale diamond tool. A new concept of atomistic equivalent temperature is proposed and used to characterize the temperature distribution in the cutting zone. The results show that the cutting heat generated while using a multi-tip tool is larger than that of using a single tip tool. The local temperature is found to be higher at the inner sides of the multi-tip tool cutting edges than the outer sides. Applying centro-symmetry parameters and radius distribution function, the local annealing process and its effect on the integrity of the machined nanostructures are analyzed. It is observed that the local annealing at the machined surface can improve the surface integrity of the machined nanostructures, especially in the multi-tip diamond tool cutting process. There exists a great potential to control the thickness of residual atomic defect layer through an optimal selection of the cutting speed with designed depth of cut.",B & E,617
A,Measurement and prediction of the resistance of a laser sailing dinghy,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/measurement-and-prediction-of-the-resistance-of-a-laser-sailing-d,"This study explores the insight that can be gained into the performance of a conventional sailing dinghy from a program of tanks testing in a range of displacement and trim conditions, and further investigates the extent to which performance can be predicted using a regression approach developed for sailing yachts, with the ultimate aim of developing performance prediction tools customised for sailing dinghies.

The upright resistance of a Laser Dinghy is examined through tank-testing at three different displacements and with a range of trims. Results show that residuary resistance is substantially affected by displacement, and that trim can have a beneficial effect at the lower and upper extremes of the speed range. Comparison with tank test results show that the Delft regression approach does not predict the resistance of a Laser particularly accurately, substantially underestimates the weight sensitivity of a Laser, and cannot reliably predict the impact of trim.",E & F,889
B,Antioxidant properties of amniotic membrane: novel observations from a pilot study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/antioxidant-properties-of-amniotic-membrane-novel-observations-fr,"Objective

Amniotic membrane (AM) is used to manage various debilitated ocular surface conditions. The impact of oxidative stress and free radicals on the ocular surface is increasingly being recognized. Hyaluronic acid (HA) has anti-inflammatory properties and is abundantly present in AM. In this in vitro pilot study, we investigated the potential of AM for intrinsic free radical scavenging properties.
Methods

Strips of AM were incubated in sealed tubes with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). After being sonicated, uptake of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured by the Amplex Red Hydrogen Peroxide/Peroxidase assay. For comparison, 1630 kDA HA was used.
Results
There was uptake of ROS by all AM samples, which decreased with increasing concentrations of H2O2. Mean ROS uptake for 5 different AMs at 1 hour was significantly greater for 50 μM (83%; SD 11.7, SEM 5.23) compared with 100 μM (67%; SD 20.48, SEM 9.16; p = 0.028; 95% CI 2.8-29.2). The HA comparison group showed similar uptake and trend. 
Conclusion
This pilot study demonstrates that AM is able to remove ROS from its environment. Demonstrating total antioxidant capacity in AM provides evidence for use as a free radical scavenger. The antioxidant properties of AM and the contribution from HA require more research.",F & K,857

A,The franchise relationship in China: agency and institutional theory perspectives,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-franchise-relationship-in-china-agency-and-institutional-theo,"Purpose: Explores the franchise relationship in China, focusing on the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict in this developing franchise environment. Agency theory has dominated franchise research. A more rounded theoretical interpretation of the franchising relationship is offered by employing both agency theory and institutional theory perspectives.
Design/methodology/approach: Adopts an interpretive approach, employing in-depth interviews with franchisors and franchisees in nine franchise organisations operating in the retail sector in China. Contributes a fuller understanding of how to manage the research process in China.
Findings: Reveals how the relational constructs of power, control, support and conflict are manifest in the franchise relationship in China. The explanatory power of agency theory is apparent when viewed in terms of the vertical agency problem. However, free riding outside the franchise system, in the form of counterfeiting, mitigates against the occurrence of free riding within it. With regard to institutional theory, we demonstrate that the regulatory institutional pillar is a crucial foundation for the franchise relationship.
Practical implications: Offers insights for franchisors and franchisees considering franchise relationships in China.
Originality/value: For the first time in the literature, we offer insights into key elements of the franchise relationship in China. Employing both agency theory and institutional theory facilitates a rounded explanation of the developing franchise environment in China.",A & G,454
D,Buckling analysis of stiffened variable angle tow panels,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/buckling-analysis-of-stiffened-variable-angle-tow-panels,"Variable angle tow (VAT) laminates have previously shown enhanced buckling performance compared to conventional straight fibre laminates. In this study, an analytical method is developed for the buckling analysis of a novel blade stiffened VAT panel to allow this potential to be more fully exploited. The prebuckling and buckling analysis, performed on a representative section of a blade stiffened VAT panel, are based on a generalised Rayleigh–Ritz procedure. The buckling analysis includes a first order shear deformation theory by introducing additional shape functions for transverse shear and is therefore applicable to structures with thick skins relative to characteristic length. Modelling of the stiffener is achieved with two approaches; idealisation as a beam attached to the skin’s midplane and as a rigidly attached plate. Comparing results with finite element analysis (Abaqus) for selected case studies, local buckling errors for the beam model and plate model were found to be less than 3% and 2% respectively, whilst the beam model error for global buckling was between 3% and 10%. The analytical model provides an accurate alternative to the computationally expensive finite element analysis and is therefore suitable for future work on the design and optimisation of stiffened VAT panels.",H & L,496

C,Spontaneous emission and thermalization of cold bosons in optical lattices,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/spontaneous-emission-and-thermalization-of-cold-bosons-in-optical,"We study the thermalization of excitations generated by spontaneous emission events for cold bosons in an optical lattice. Computing the dynamics described by the many-body master equation, we characterize equilibration time scales in different parameter regimes. For simple observables, we find regimes in which the system relaxes rapidly to values in agreement with a thermal distribution, and others where thermalization does not occur on typical experimental time scales. Because spontaneous emissions lead effectively to a local quantum quench, this behavior is strongly dependent on the low-energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian, and undergoes a qualitative change at the Mott insulator-superfluid transition point. These results have important implications for the understanding of thermalization after localized quenches in isolated quantum gases, as well as the characterization of heating in experiments.",C,880
E,Light scattering and dissipative dynamics of many fermionic atoms in an optical lattice,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/light-scattering-and-dissipative-dynamics-of-many-fermionic-atoms,"We investigate the many-body dissipative dynamics of fermionic atoms in an optical lattice in the presence of incoherent light scattering. Deriving and solving a master equation to describe this process microscopically for many particles, we observe contrasting behaviour in terms of the robustness against this type of heating for different many-body states. In particular, we find that the magnetic correlations exhibited by a two-component gas in the Mott insulating phase should be particularly robust against decoherence from light scattering, because the decoherence in the lowest band is suppressed by a larger factor than the timescales for effective superexchange interactions that drive coherent dynamics. Furthermore, the derived formalism naturally generalizes to analogous states with SU(N) symmetry. In contrast, for typical atomic and laser parameters, two-particle correlation functions describing bound dimers for strong attractive interactions exhibit superradiant effects due to the indistinguishability of off-resonant photons scattered by atoms in different internal states. This leads to rapid decay of correlations describing off-diagonal long-range order for these states. Our predictions should be directly measurable in ongoing experiments, providing a basis for characterising and controlling heating processes in quantum simulation with fermions.",B & E,285

A series of five structurally related N-benzyl-substituted diketopyrrolopyrroles (DPPs) differing solely in 2 out their 60 atoms were synthesized and crystal structures obtained. Systematic variation of the long axis aligned, π−π stacks has been identified within the single crystal structure series and intermolecular interaction energies and charge transfer integrals for the π−π stacks have been computed by means of density functional theory (M06-2X/6-311G(d)). The computed intermolecular interaction energies as well as charge transfer integrals were further investigated utilizing a series of systematically cropped dimer pairs, highlighting the crucial role of the benzyl/halo substitution on stabilization of these π−π dimers. Two of the DPPs, including a new polymorph of a previously reported structure exhibit twice the intermolecular interaction energy and comparable hole transfer integrals to Rubrene, one of the most efficient hole conducting materials known. The computed properties for all of the π−π dimer systems reported herein are consistent with trends predicted by a model system. As such these materials show great promise as charge mediators in organic electronic applications and may be exploited in systematic structure activity based investigations of charge transfer theory.",E & F,877
B,The parasitic worm product ES-62 up-regulates IL-22 production by γδ T cells in the murine model of collagen-induced arthritis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-parasitic-worm-product-es-62-up-regulates-il-22-production-by,"ES-62 is a phosphorylcholine (PC)-containing glycoprotein secreted by the filarial nematode Acanthocheilonema viteae that acts to modulate the host immune response to promote the establishment of chronic helminth infection. Reflecting its anti-inflammatory actions, we have previously reported that ES-62 protects mice from developing Collagen-Induced Arthritis (CIA): thus, as this helminth-derived product may exhibit therapeutic potential in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), it is important to understand the protective immunoregulatory mechanisms triggered by ES-62 in this model in vivo. We have established to date that ES-62 acts by downregulating pathogenic Th17/IL-17-mediated responses and upregulating the regulatory cytokine IL-10. In addition, our studies have identified that IL-22, another member of the IL-10 family of cytokines, exerts dual pathogenic and protective roles in this model of RA with ES-62 harnessing the cytokine's inflammation-resolving and tissue repair properties in the joint during the established phase of disease. Here, we discuss the counter-regulatory roles of IL-22 in the murine model of CIA and present additional novel data showing that ES-62 selectively induces γδ T cells with the capacity to induce IL-22 production and that γδ T cells with the capacity to produce IL-22, but not IL-17, induced during CIA can be identified by their expression of TLR4. Moreover, we also show that treatment of mice undergoing CIA with the active PC moiety of ES-62, in the form of PC conjugated to BSA, is not only sufficient to mimic the ES-62-dependent suppression of pathogenic IL-17 responses shown previously but also that of the IL-22 and IL-10 up-regulation observed with the parasitic worm product during CIA. These findings not only reinforce the potential of IL-22, firstly described as a Th17-related pro-inflammatory cytokine, as a protective factor in arthritis but also suggest that drugs based on the PC moiety found in ES-62 may be able to harness the joint-protecting activities of IL-22 therapeutically.",F & K,482

Rhodamine B (Rh B) and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) as model hydrophilic and hydrophobic small/medium-size molecules, respectively, were encapsulated in poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles (NPs) and delivered through full thickness porcine skin pretreated with MN array. Permeation through MN-treated skin was affected by physicochemical characteristics of NPs and the encapsulated dyes. Dye flux was enhanced by smaller particle size, hydrophilicity, and negative zeta potential of NPs. Regarding encapsulated dyes, solubility at physiological pH and potential interaction with skin proteins proved to outweigh molecular weight as determinants of skin permeation. Data were verified using confocal laser scanning microscopy imaging. Findings coupled with the literature data are supportive of a mechanism involving influx of NPs, particularly of smaller size, deep into MN-created channels, generating depot dye-rich reservoirs. Molecular diffusion of the released dye across viable skin layers proceeds at a rate determined by its molecular characteristics. Data obtained provide mechanistic information of importance to the development of formulation strategies for more effective intradermal and transdermal MN-mediated delivery of nanoencapsulated therapeutic agents.",B & L,948

This work presents an architecture that identifies trends between conflicting objectives (e.g. lifecycle cost and performance) and decision variables (e.g. orbit altitude and inclination) such that informed assessment can be made as to which design/s to take on for further analysis. The models within the architecture exploit analytic methods where possible, in order avoid computationally expensive numerical propagation, and achieve rapid convergence. Two mission cases are studied; the first is an Earth observation satellite and presents a trade-off between ground sample distance and revisit time over a ground target, given altitude as the decision variable. The second is a satellite with a generic scientific payload and shows a more involved trade-off, between data return to a ground station and cost of the mission, given variations in the orbit altitude, inclination and ground station latitude. Results of each case are presented graphically and it is clear that non-intuitive results are captured that would typically be missed using traditional, point-design methods, where only discrete scenarios are examined.",E & A,440
B,Novel multivariate vector quantization for effective compression of hyperspectral imagery,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/novel-multivariate-vector-quantization-for-effective-compression-,"Although hyperspectral imagery (HSI) has been successfully deployed in a wide range of applications, it suffers from extremely large data volumes for storage and transmission. Consequently, coding and compression is needed for effective data reduction whilst maintaining the image integrity. In this paper, a multivariate vector quantization (MVQ) approach is proposed for the compression of HSI, where the pixel spectra is considered as a linear combination of two codewords from the codebook, and the indexed maps and their corresponding coefficients are separately coded and compressed. A strategy is proposed for effective codebook design, using the fuzzy C-mean (FCM) to determine the optimal number of clusters of data and selected codewords for the codebook. Comprehensive experiments on several real datasets are used for performance assessment, including quantitative evaluations to measure the degree of data reduction and the distortion of reconstructed images. Our results have indicated that the proposed MVQ approach outperforms conventional VQ and several typical algorithms for effective compression of HSI, where the image quality measured using mean squared error (MSE) has been significantly improved even under the same level of compressed bitrate.",A & G,497

Forty 4–6-year-olds (5.3 ± 1.0 years) completed a ~150-min room calorimeter protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary behaviours (SBs), light intensity physical activities (LPAs) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activities (MVPAs). AEE and/or physical activity intensity were calculated using Actical equations and cut-points by Adolph, Evenson, Pfeiffer and Puyau. Predictive validity was examined using paired sample t-tests. Classification accuracy was evaluated using weighted kappas, sensitivity, specificity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The Pfeiffer equation significantly overestimated AEE during SB and underestimated AEE during LPA (P < 0.0125 for both). There was no significant difference between measured and predicted AEEs during MVPA. The Adolph cut-point showed significantly higher accuracy for classifying SB, LPA and MVPA than all others. The available Actical equation does not provide accurate estimates of AEE across all intensities in preschoolers. However, the Pfeiffer equation performed reasonably well for MVPA. Using cut-points of ≤6 counts · 15 s−1, 7–286 counts · 15 s−1 and ≥ 287 counts · 15 s−1 when classifying SB, LPA and MVPA, respectively, is recommended.",H & L,861

The design system is implemented by using commercial software, such as Pro/E, Matlab and Ansys. Consequently, the integrated dynamic design system enables the designers to cost-effectively complete structural design of an aerostatic spindle.

E,Use of pressure spectral maps for analysis of influence of the plenum volume on the surge in centrifugal blower,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/use-of-pressure-spectral-maps-for-analysis-of-influence-of-the-pl,"The influence of plenum volume on surge phenomenon in a centrifugal blower was studied by means of quasidynamic analysis. In this procedure, signals were
gathered at 5 pressure tappings at 146 different positions of the throttling valve controlling the mass flow rate. Frequency spectra obtained by means of Fourier analysis are combined together in the form of colour maps with frequency as the abscissa and valve position as the ordinate. Such a map provides high-resolution information about spectral structures of pressure signals
attained at different mass flow rates. Analysis was conducted at two system configurations characterized by different volumes between the blower and the valve i.e. plenum volume. Research confirmed that in both cases the first disturbances appear in the vicinity of the impeller leading edge in the same position of a throttling valve before the surge. Arising flow structure is characterized by strong and random pressure jumps and does not have any dominating frequency. At further valve closure pressure disturbances propagate towards the volute and at deep surge the strongest peaks are observed at the
outlet. The moment of deep surge onset is also independent of the plenum volume, however, a difference is observed in the frequency and amplitude of the main modes. With the higher outlet volume the observed oscillations fit well to the frequency of a Helmholtz resonator while, in the case of the smaller volume, the frequency is higher than the frequency of a corresponding Helmholtz resonator.",B & E,478

The impetus for the Summit came from Jenny Molloy’s contribution at the 2013 Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care (SIRCC) annual conference. Jenny’s insights provoked a powerful response among participants and encouraged CELCIS and Hackney Child to bring together learning from both north and south of the border. The aim of the Summit was to explore residential child care in Scotland and England and consider how we can make improvements in what we do, wherever we work. It brought together participants from Scotland and England from government, national bodies, services and academics with an interest in residential child care.",F & K,734
B,Numerical simulation of unconstrained cyclotron resonant maser emission,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/numerical-simulation-of-unconstrained-cyclotron-resonant-maser-em,"When a mainly rectilinear electron beam is subject to significant magnetic
compression, conservation of magnetic moment results in the formation of a horseshoe shaped velocity distribution. It has been shown that such a distribution is unstable to cyclotron emission and may be responsible for the generation of Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) - an intense rf emission sourced at high altitudes in the terrestrial auroral magnetosphere. PiC
code simulations have been undertaken to investigate the dynamics of the cyclotron emission process in the absence of cavity boundaries with particular consideration of the spatial growth rate, spectral output and rf conversion efficiency. Computations reveal that a well-defined cyclotron emission process occurs albeit with a low spatial growth rate compared to waveguide bounded simulations. The rf output is near perpendicular to the electron beam with a slight backward-wave character reflected in the spectral output with a well defined peak at 2.68GHz, just below the relativistic electron cyclotron frequency. The corresponding rf conversion efficiency of 1.1% is comparable to waveguide bounded simulations and consistent with the predictions of kinetic theory that suggest efficient, spectrally well defined radiation emission can be obtained from an electron horseshoe distribution in the absence of radiation boundaries.",M & I,213
D,Metabolomic tools for secondary metabolite discovery from marine microbial symbionts,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/metabolomic-tools-for-secondary-metabolite-discovery-from-marine-,"Marine invertebrate-associated symbiotic bacteria produce a plethora of novel secondary metabolites which may be structurally unique with interesting pharmacological properties. Selection of strains usually relies on literature searching, genetic screening and bioactivity results, often without considering the chemical novelty and abundance of secondary metabolites being produced by the microorganism until the time-consuming bioassay-guided isolation stages. To fast track the selection process, metabolomic tools were used to aid strain selection by investigating differences in the chemical profiles of 77 bacterial extracts isolated from cold water marine invertebrates from Orkney, Scotland using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following mass spectrometric analysis and dereplication using an Excel macro developed in-house, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to differentiate the bacterial strains based on their chemical profiles. NMR 1H and correlation spectroscopy (COSY) were also employed to obtain a chemical fingerprint of each bacterial strain and to confirm the presence of functional groups and spin systems. These results were then combined with taxonomic identification and bioassay screening data to identify three bacterial strains, namely Bacillus sp. 4117, Rhodococcus sp. ZS402 and Vibrio splendidus strain LGP32, to prioritize for scale-up based on their chemically interesting secondary metabolomes, established through dereplication and interesting bioactivities, determined from bioassay screening.",B & L,149
C,"I love you, man: gendered narratives of friendship in contemporary romantic comedies",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/i-love-you-man-gendered-narratives-of-friendship-in-contemporary-,"This article begins with a simple observation: there are very few contemporary Hollywood films in which women are shown becoming friends. This is in contrast to the “bromance,” in which new connections between men are privileged, yet this pattern has gone largely unremarked in the literature. This article has two aims: to sketch this pattern and explore reasons for it through comparing the “girlfriend flick” and “bromance.” To do this, we first discuss those rare occasions when women do become friends on screen, using Jackie Stacey's work to understand the difficulties this narrative trajectory poses for Hollywood. This raises questions about the relationship between the homosocial and homosexual which set up our comparison of female and male friendship films and provides the rationale for our focus on the beginnings of friendships as moments where tensions around gendered fascinations are most obvious. The films discussed are Baby Mama, Step Brothers, I Love You, Man, Funny People, Due Date, and Crazy, Stupid, Love. The differences we identify hinge on issues of gendered representability and identification which have long been at the heart of feminist film scholarship.",E & A,505
A,A fast secure dot product protocol with application to privacy preserving association rule mining,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-fast-secure-dot-product-protocol-with-application-to-privacy-pr,"Data mining often causes privacy concerns. To ease the concerns, various privacy preserving data mining techniques have been proposed. However, those techniques are often too computationally intensive to be deployed in practice. Efficiency becomes a major challenge in privacy preserving data mining. In this paper we present an efficient secure dot product protocol and show its application in privacy preserving association rule mining, one of the most widely used data mining techniques. The protocol is orders of magnitude faster than previous protocols because it employs mostly cheap cryptographic operations, e.g. hashing and modular multiplication. The performance has been further improved by parallelization. We implemented the protocol and tested the performance. The test result shows that on moderate commodity hardware, the dot product of two vectors of size 1 million can be computed within 1 minute. As a comparison, the currently most widely used protocol needs about 1 hour and 23 minutes.",A & G,733
D,Analysis of a model for foam improved oil recovery,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/analysis-of-a-model-for-foam-improved-oil-recovery,"During improved oil recovery (IOR), gas may be introduced into a porous reservoir filled with surfactant solution in order to form foam. A model for the evolution of the resulting foam front known as ‘pressure-driven growth’ is analysed. An asymptotic solution of this model for long times is derived that shows that foam can propagate indefinitely into the reservoir without gravity override. Moreover, ‘pressure-driven growth’ is shown to correspond to a special case of the more general ‘viscous froth’ model. In particular, it is a singular limit of the viscous froth, corresponding to the elimination of a surface tension term, permitting sharp corners and kinks in the predicted shape of the front. Sharp corners tend to develop from concave regions of the front. The principal solution of interest has a convex front, however, so that although this solution itself has no sharp corners (except for some kinks that develop spuriously owing to errors in a numerical scheme), it is found nevertheless to exhibit milder singularities in front curvature, as the long-time asymptotic analytical solution makes clear. Numerical schemes for the evolving front shape which perform robustly (avoiding the development of spurious kinks) are also developed. Generalisations of this solution to geologically heterogeneous reservoirs should exhibit concavities and/or sharp corner singularities as an inherent part of their evolution: propagation of fronts containing such ‘inherent’ singularities can be readily incorporated into these numerical schemes.",H & L,764

C,Open innovation management through strategic implementation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/open-innovation-management-through-strategic-implementation,"There is wide agreement about the activities that encompass open innovation. However, little attention has been given towards the extent to which firms have strategically adopted open innovation within their organisation. The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of corporate strategy on this emergent paradigm. This paper therefore analyses two distinct cases of open innovation in practice from the oil and gas industry. Empirical data suggests that it is possible to provide countless examples of observed open innovation activity. However, these are not necessarily a direct cause of strategic intent towards implementing 
open innovation. Findings also show that if open innovation is to become a professionally managed activity, research needs to be aligned towards strategy of the firm. Open innovation is a change process that requires attention and commitment levels much like Lean and Six Sigma initiatives. This paper provides empirical evidence to show that open innovation should be concerned with the strategic transformation of an organisation through a shift in organisational culture that requires a managed process.",C,432
E,Power conversion and signal transmission integration method based on dual modulation of DC-DC converters,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/power-conversion-and-signal-transmission-integration-method-based,"For the development of communication systems such as Internet of Things, integrating communication with power supplies is an attractive solution to reduce supply cost. This paper presents a novel method of power/signal Dual Modulation (PSDM), by which signal transmission is integrated with power conversion. This method takes advantage of the intrinsic ripple initiated in switch mode power supplies as signal carriers, by which a cost-effective communications can be realized. The principles of PSDM are discussed and two basic dual modulation methods (specifically PWM/FSK and PWM/PSK) are concluded. The key points of designing a PWM/FSK system, including topology selection, carrier shape and carrier frequency are discussed to provide theoretical guidelines. A practical signal modulation-demodulation method is given and a prototype system provides experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed solution.",B & E,851

Ce0.8Gd0.2O2-δ (CGO)-(Li,Na,K)2CO3 electrolyte together with a new perovskite oxide Pr0.6Ba0.4Fe0.8Cu0.2O3-δ were used for electrochemical synthesis of ammonia. An ammonia formation rate of 1.07×10-6mols-1m-2 was obtained at 400°C when applied a voltage of 1.4V, while wet air was introduced to the single chamber reactor. This is just slightly lower than the value of 1.83×10-6mols-1m-2 when wet N2 was fed under the same experimental conditions. These values are two to three orders of magnitude higher than the reported ammonia formation rates when synthesised from N2 and H2O at ~600°C.

Specifically, there was a concern that proof of the absence of a defence (such as self-defence and provocation) would now be required to establish the mens rea of wicked intention to kill.  Contemporaneous and subsequent cases (Galbraith v HM Advocate 2002 JC 1 (diminished responsibility) and Lord Advocate’s Reference No 1 of 2000 2001 JC 143 (necessity)) were closely scrutinised to see if the trend was borne out in relation to other defences and other crimes.  Though this appeared not to be the case, the issue itself remains worthy of scrutiny.  This chapter examines that issue more generally, from a normative perspective, in relation to necessity, coercion and automatism in Scots law.

The impact of the proposed technique on energy saving and network performance is assessed; results are presented and evaluated for various scenarios. Evaluation of this methodology indicates potential reduction in power consumption from 7 % up to 15 % at the expense of reduced network performance.",A & G,804
C,"Good kings, bloody tyrants, and everything in between: representations of the monarchy in post-genocide Rwanda",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/good-kings-bloody-tyrants-and-everything-in-between-representatio,"Since assuming power after the 1994 genocide, President Paul Kagame and his political party, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, have struggled to unite Rwanda's citizens using, among other initiatives, a simplified version of Rwandan history to diminish the ethnic tensions that made the 1994 genocide possible. As a result, Rwanda's history has become highly politicized, with vastly divergent versions of the nation’s past narrated in private settings, where it is more politically appropriate for Rwandans to share their experiences. This paper focuses on divergent representations of Rwandan monarchical figures – often unnamed – whom the narrators imbue with values according to their individual political affiliations, lived experiences, and identity. These narratives are indicative of the broader ways that modern Rwandans narrate their experiences of history in response to Rwanda's current official history, as well as previous official histories. Careful analysis reveals much about the current political climate in post-genocide Rwanda: most notably, that Rwandans continue to see their nation's past through vastly different lenses, demonstrating the enormous challenges facing the Rwandan government as it seeks to reconcile its population using current methods. It also highlights the ongoing need on the part of historians to approach contemporary sources critically, informed by sources produced and debated in the pre-genocide period.",H & L,679

The PCEPS consists of 15 items with two subscales: Person Centred Process, and Experiential Process. Method: One-hundred twenty audio-recorded segments of therapy sessions were rated independently by two teams of three raters using the PCEPS. Half of the segments were 10 min long and the other half were 15 min long. Six therapists were experienced therapists and four were counsellors in training. Seven of the therapists identified their work as 'person-centred’, and three identifed their work as 'process-experiential'. Three raters were qualified and experienced person- centred therapists and three raters were person-centred counselling trainees in their first year of training. Results: Interrater reliabilities were good (alpha: .68 - .86), especially when ratings were averaged across items (alpha: .87); interitem reliabilities were quite high (alpha: .98). Exploratory factor analyses revealed a 12-item facilitative relationship factor that cuts across Person-centred and Experiential subscales (alpha: .98), and a nonfacilitative directiveness factor (3 items, alpha: .89). Conclusions/Implications: The PCEPS has potential for use in RCT research as well as in counselling training and supervision, but will require further testing and validation.",C,588

Drawing upon insights from military personnel, intelligence operatives, journalists and others, this study uses Social Exchange Theory (SET) to frame our understanding of their underpinning cultural code, the Pashtunwali. The study contributes both theoretically and empirically: The nature of the Pashtunwali highlights that SET cannot adequately frame some cultural exchange practices and a hybrid framework for negotiated and reciprocal exchange is presented. Furthermore, contextually, this is the first study that explores a code of hospitality through a social exchange lens to explore potential tourism development.  A framework exists upon which commercial activity can be built without altering beliefs, social dynamics or day to day pursuits. For commercial development to be successful, it must yield similar or greater levels of income to those that currently exist, more importantly, traditions of autonomy and self-dependence will affect employment and training within an emergent tourism industry.",B & E,711
A,Concurrence of monoenergetic electron beams and bright X-rays from an evolving laser-plasma bubble,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/concurrence-of-monoenergetic-electron-beams-and-bright-x-rays-fro,"Desktop laser plasma acceleration has proven to be able to generate gigaelectronvolt-level quasi-monoenergetic electron beams. Moreover, such electron beams can oscillate transversely (wiggling motion) in the laser-produced plasma bubble/channel and emit collimated ultrashort X-ray flashes known as betatron radiation with photon energy ranging from kiloelectronvolts to mega-electronvolts. This implies that usually one cannot obtain bright betatron X-rays and high-quality electron beams with low emittance and small energy spread simultaneously in the same accelerating wave bucket. Here, we report the first (to our knowledge) experimental observation of two distinct electron bunches in a single laser shot, one featured with quasi-monoenergetic spectrum and another with continuous spectrum along with large emittance. The latter is able to generate high-flux betatron X-rays. Such is observed only when the laser self-guiding is extended over 4 mm at a fixed plasma density (4 × 1018 cm-3). Numerical simulation reveals that two bunches of electrons are injected at different stages due to the bubble evolution. The first bunch is injected at the beginning to form a stable quasi-monoenergetic electron beam, whereas the second one is injected later due to the oscillation of the bubble size as a result of the change of the laser spot size during the propagation. Due to the inherent temporal synchronization, this unique electron-photon source can be ideal for pump-probe applications with femtosecond time resolution.",E & F,282

Relative deprivation is a significant predictor of potential protest but does not play any role in terms of who actually takes part in strikes or demonstrations.

RADA 16 is a simple and versatile self-assembling peptide with a designed structure formed of two distinct surfaces, one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic that are positioned such a well-ordered fashion allowing precise assembly into a predetermined organization. A “smart” architecture in nanostructures can represent a good opportunity to use RADA16 as a carrier system for hydrophobic drugs solving problems of drugs delivery. In this work, we have investigated the diffusion properties of Pindolol, Quinine and Timolol Maleate from RADA16 in PBS and in BSS-PLUS at 37 °C. A sustained, controlled, reproducible and efficient drug release has been detected for all the systems, which has allow to understand the dependence of release kinetics on the physicochemical characteristics of RADA16 structural and chemical properties of the selected drugs and the nature of solvents used. For the analysis various physicochemical characterization techniques were used in order to investigate the state of the peptide before and after the drugs were added. Not only does RADA16 optimise drug performance, but it can also provide a solution for drug delivery issues associated with lipophilic drugs.",E & A,301

A monolayer of phosphonic acid inserted between the inorganic oxide and the organic semiconductor provides two main benefits: (i) the density of the charge carrier traps associated with the surface –OH groups of the oxide is reduced because these groups act as binding sites for the organic molecules; and (ii) the low surface energy of the organic monolayer may reduce the density of defects in the subsequently deposited conjugated polymer. To date such monolayers have been assembled from solutions only. We have recently developed a vapour-phase self-assembly of n-octylphosphonic acid (C8PA) monolayer in vacuum that leads to a well chemisorbed monolayer of C8PA. When such a monolayer is attached to ~ 9-nm thick aluminium oxide to form an ultra-thin dielectric implemented in low-voltage organic thin-film transistors based on pentacene, the transistor performance exhibits measurable changes upon alteration of the structure of the C8PA monolayer.",A & B & C & D,776
B,Optimum CTV fleet selection for offshore wind farm O&M activities,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimum-ctv-fleet-selection-for-offshore-wind-farm-oampm-activiti,"Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contributes a significant share of the expenses during the lifetime of offshore wind farms. When compared to onshore wind, O&M costs are increased, due to the use of specialised vessels, shorter weather windows and challenging environmental conditions. Furthermore, increased frequency of failures, longer downtime and limited accessibility create uncertainties in the planning stage of the O&M tasks. In order to decrease the cost of power generation and increase the competitiveness of offshore wind industry against other alternative energy sectors, it is essential to keep the costs of the vessel fleet used for O&M tasks at minimum level while providing sufficient support to sustain power generation. In order to address these issues, the focus of this paper is to provide decision support for the selection of a Crew Transfer Vessel (CTV) fleet for the offshore wind farm maintenance operations. This is achieved through analyses of environmental conditions, investigation of failures, and assessment of vessel operations. The developed methodology and analysis enable operators to decide the specification of CTVs which will bring the optimum financial benefit, considering both the enhancement of the offshore wind farm power generation as well as the minimisation of the total O&M cost.",E & F & G,190
C,Seeking safety beyond refuge: the impact of immigration and citizenship policy upon refugees in the UK,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/seeking-safety-beyond-refuge-the-impact-of-immigration-and-citize,"Western states are concerned about maintaining and securing national borders. Across Europe, one response has been to implement restrictive asylum regimes that prevent ‘bogus’ applicants and grant refuge only to the ‘deserving’. Alongside these concerns, states are eager to encourage socially cohesive communities. One recent tool adopted by the UK government has been citizenship policy, including English language/life in the UK tests and citizenship ceremonies. By drawing upon in-depth interviews with refugees in Scotland (UK), this paper explores the impact of the current asylum regime and citizenship policies from the perspective of individual voices that are often absent from
wider debates. It explores how temporary refugee status impacts upon  individuals’ everyday lives including employment and education, and impacts upon children. The data also question the reasons for refugees deciding to become British citizens (or not) and highlight instrumental reasons alongside less tangible factors such as gaining a sense of security. Taking the discussion forward, the study explores some unintended consequences of immigration and citizenship policies in the UK. The research suggests that not only do restrictive asylum policies negatively impact upon refugees and their integration but also serve to elevate fear and uncertainty, which can unintentionally spur individuals to seek naturalisation.",H,755

Weighted Modal Logic (WML) is a multi-modal logic that expresses qualitative and quantitative properties of WTSs. While WML has been studied in various contexts and for various application domains, no proof system has been developed for it. In this paper we solve this open problem and propose both weak-complete and strong-complete axiomatizations for WML against WTSs. We prove a series of metatheorems including the finite model property and the existence of canonical models. We show how the proof system can be used in the context of a process-algebra semantics for WML to convert a model-checking problem into a theorem-proving problem.

The start of this year has seen an upswing in business confidence, particularly around new orders and intentions to invest, while the Bank of England‟s monetary policy continues to be unprecedented at this early stage of the recovery, and designed to accommodate an increase in economic activity, particularly investment, which remains subdued by historic standards. In this context, we have raised slightly our forecast for growth in this year. Downside risks to growth remain, with households – critical for the first phase of the recovery to date – continuing to face slow real income growth. While inflation pressures have eased, it appears likely that strong household earnings growth will not return until 2015. Rebalancing towards exports continues to be hampered by sluggish export performance, and external markets remain weak, although the outlook for the US – Scotland‟s largest single (non-UK) export destination – is forecast to grow strongly through 2014 and 2015.",B & C & D,121
E,Supplementing wind turbine pitch control with a trailing edge flap smart rotor,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/supplementing-wind-turbine-pitch-control-with-a-trailing-edge-fla,"Placement of additional control devices along the span of the wind turbine blades is being considered for multi-MW wind turbines to actively alter the local aerodynamic characteristics of the blades. This smart rotor approach can reduce loads on the rotor due to wind field non-uniformity, but also, as presented in this paper, can supplement the pitch control system. Rotor speed and tower vibration damping are actively controlled using pitch. By supplementing the speed control using smart rotor control, pitch actuator travel is reduced by 15 pitch rates by 23 and pitch accelerations by 42 This is achieved through filtering the pitch demand such that high frequency signals are dealt with by the smart rotor devices while the low frequency signal is dealt with by pitching the blades. It is also shown that this may be achieved while also using the smart rotor control for load reduction, though with reduced effectiveness. This shows that smart rotor control can be used to trade pitch actuator requirements as well as load reductions with the cost of installing and maintaining the distributed devices.",E & F,748
C,Inductance and current distribution analysis of a prototype HTS cable,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/inductance-and-current-distribution-analysis-of-a-prototype-hts-c,"This project is partly supported by NSFC Grant 51207146, RAEng Research Exchange scheme of UK and EPSRC EP/K01496X/1. Superconducting cable is an emerging technology for electricity power transmission. Since the high power capacity HTS transmission cables are manufactured using a multi-layer conductor structure, the current distribution among the multilayer structure would be nonuniform without proper optimization and hence lead to large transmission losses. Therefore a novel optimization method has been developed to achieve evenly distributed current among different layers considering the HTS cable structure parameters: radius, pitch angle and winding direction which determine the self and mutual inductance. A prototype HTS cable has been built using BSCCO tape and tested to validate the design the optimal design method. A superconductor characterization system has been developed using the Labview and NI data acquisition system. It can be used to measure the AC loss and current distribution of short HTS cables.",H & J,811

Unique regulatory provisions allow IPO investors in India to have access to the independent assessment of firm quality and information on the participation of other investors, including institutional investors. At the same time, an active grey market reveals market sentiment before the application for subscription is closed. The results, which are robust to alternative model specifications, suggest that the institutional investors' decision is guided almost exclusively by firm quality while the retail investors' decision to participate in IPOs is strongly influenced by market sentiment, even in a highly transparent market where both sets of information are freely available.",L & K & C,877
D,Competing objectives in domestic demand side management: learning from the Northern Isles New Energy Solutions projects,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/competing-objectives-in-domestic-demand-side-management-learning-,"Implementing the smart grid requires coordinating competing objectives and constraints from multiple engineering domains. This paper explores the challenges involved in scheduling flexible demand according to objectives in two: the power system and household heat domains. The context is the Northern Isles New Energy Solutions project on the Shetland Islands, UK, where Active Network Management is being used to schedule flexible electric storage and immersion heaters. The study highlights that simplifications and assumptions in both domains must be coordinated to understand the overall effectiveness of a scheme. In the case study, customer facing objectives such as home comfort levels are prioritised over the power system objective of reducing fossil fuel generation. Power system operation aggregates houses into a small number of groups to allow practical scheduling. Modelling results show that this prioritisation and aggregation achieves a reduction in fossil fuel generation of 0.71GWh; 65% of that achieved if customer facing objectives are not prioritised.",A & D,674
E,"The role of social networks in agricultural innovation: the Sutherland reclamations and the Fowler steam plough, c.1855-c.1885",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-role-of-social-networks-in-agricultural-innovation-the-suther,"The nineteenth century saw an explosion in creativity and innovation,
often applied to and motivated by an urge to improve, refine and make more efficient industrial and agricultural processes. There were many innovations in the field of agriculture, supported by the sponsorship of societies and associations and, in the 1850s and 1860s, by strong investment under High Farming. This article examines one of these innovations, the steam plough, with reference to its application in the Scottish Highlands in the 1870s and 1880s. In particular, it illuminates the social networks which lay behind the development and utilisation of the steam plough in the rural Highland context, delineating how aristocratic, religious and local networks combined to have a major impact on rural society in Scotland and beyond. It will examine how these networks interacted to promote the contemporary culture for agricultural and rural innovation through the development of the Fowler’s steam
plough.What makes this example of particular interest is the fact that agriculturally and financially, the Sutherland land reclamations were an unconditional failure.
The environment was too challenging for the technology and despite vast financial resources, the landowner, the third Duke of Sutherland, was, after fifteen years, finally convinced by his advisors that further efforts were futile and irresponsible. This article will interrogate why, despite its essential unfeasibility, the project was pursued, and will argue that the momentum created by the dynamic between the three networks involved propelled it forward despite growing evidence of failure.
This article therefore uses an inductive approach by examining a particular example of agricultural design innovation and analysing the pertinent social issues in what would have been termed by contemporaries ‘entrepreneurial spirit’.",F & L & B,231

The proposed model is suitable for dynamic studies of microgrids, considering changes in the active and reactive powers, bus voltages, currents and frequency. The developed model is evaluated using simulation results obtained from a medium-voltage microgrid and test measurements recorded in a low-voltage microgrid laboratory test facility.

A,Non-invasive multiresidue screening methods for the determination of pesticides in heritage collections,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/non-invasive-multiresidue-screening-methods-for-the-determination,"This paper describes the development of a novel non-invasive sampling and analysis method that can be used to assess the presence of volatile pesticides on objects held in heritage collections. Vapour phase sampling was conducted using sampling tubes loaded with Tenax-TA™ and trapped analytes were determined using thermal desorption-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS). The results of this study are presented in a simple ‘decision tree’ diagram to provide the heritage sector with the best methods to identify the presence of pesticides in collections. To illustrate the use of the methodology developed, the results from two case studies in heritage institutions are presented. Attempts were made to measure a range of pesticides, known to have been used in heritage collections, in the vapour phase including aldrin, camphor, chloronaphthalene, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (4,4′-DDT), dichlorvos, dieldrin, endrin, a mixture of α-, β-, γ- and δ-hexachlorocyclohexane (hereafter referred to as HCH), naphthalene, and thymol. Of the analytes included in this study, as expected 4,4′-DDT was not sufficiently volatile to be detected in the vapour phase and swab sampling (using hexane) is recommended for this analyte. After method development and validation, the air inside a display case (Swiss Cottage, Isle of Wight) was sampled. The results gave a positive identification for camphor, chloronaphthalene and naphthalene. In contrast, the air around a ceremonial dance mask from the British Museum was analysed but no volatile pesticides were identified. In this case, liquid chromatographic analysis of swab samples from the mask yielded a positive identification of dichlorvos. The proposed non-invasive sampling methods require sampling of a volume of air around an object. To be detected the pesticide must possess suitable volatility. It was demonstrated that camphor, chloronaphthalene, naphthalene and thymol could be successfully trapped onto Tenax TA™ sorbent tubes and pseudo-quantitatively analysed using TD-GC-MS. Dichlorvos, HCH, aldrin, dieldrin and endrin were also trapped onto Tenax TA™ and qualitatively detected by TD-GC-MS. Although a key objective of the developed methods was non-invasive sampling, the low volatility of 4,4′-DDT precluded it from vapour phase monitoring and hexane swabbing followed by HPLC analysis was required.",I & C & M,507

By doing this we can consider the suitability for AR at each stage as opposed to the use of hand drawings, basic computer aided design, virtual reality, or rapid prototyping techniques and suchlike to produce physical models.

A,"Determination of load capacity of a nongasketed flange joint under combined internal pressure, axial and bending loading for safe strength and sealing",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/determination-of-load-capacity-of-a-nongasketed-flange-joint-unde,"Performance of a bolted flange joint is characterized mainly due to its ‘strength’ and ‘sealing capability’. A number of analytical and experimental studies have been conducted to study these characteristics only under internal pressure loading. A very limited work is found in literature under combined internal
pressure and bending loading. Due to the ignorance of external loads i.e. bending and axial in addition to the internal pressure loading, an optimized performance of the bolted flange joint can not be achieved. The present
design codes do not address the effects of combined loading on the structural integrity and sealing ability. To investigate joint strength and sealing capability under combined loading, an extensive comparative experimental and numerical study of a non-gasketed flange joint with two different taper angles on the flange surface and with different load combinations is carried out and overall joint performance and behavior is discussed. Actual joint load capacity is determined under both the design and proof test pressures with maximum additional external loading (axial and bending) that can be applied for safe joint performance.",A & B & C & D,242

C,Cyclic yield strength in definition of design limits for fatigue and creep,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cyclic-yield-strength-in-definition-of-design-limits-for-fatigue-,"This study proposes a cyclic yield strength (CYS, σc ) as a key characteristic  for the definition  of safe design for engineering structures operating under fatigue and creep conditions.  CYS is defined on a cyclic stress-strain  curve, while monotonic yield strength (MYS, σm ) is defined on a monotonic  stress-strain curve.   Both values of σc  and σm  are identified  using a 2-steps fitting procedure of the experimental stress-strain curves using Ramberg-Osgood and Chaboche material models. Comparison of σc  and fatigue endurance limit σf on the S-N fatigue curve reveals that they are approximately  equal. Hence, basically safe fatigue design is guaranteed in purely elastic domain defined by the σc . A typical creep rupture curve in time-to-failure approach for creep analysis has 2 inflections corresponding to the σc  and σm .  These stresses separate 3 sections on the creep rupture curve, which are characterised by 3 different creep fracture modes and 3 creep  deformation mechanisms. Thus, basically safe creep design is guaranteed in linear creep domain with  brittle failure mode defined by the σc . These assumptions are confirmed for several structural low- and high-alloy steels for normal and high-temperature 
applications.",H,359

In practice the system is little used, but evidence from where it is indicates much depends on how voters choose to use it. STV was used for the first time in Scottish local elections in 2007, providing valuable new evidence on how voters respond to the system. We use survey data to examine the incidence of various indicators of apparent failure by Scottish voters to exploit STV, and compare both the levels and patterns of incidence with equivalent data for Ireland. We find little sign of confusion in either country, but significant evidence of ballot order effects in Scotland.",I & J,286

In cold atoms, the spontaneous emergence of spatial structures due to opto- mechanical back-action has been observed in one dimension in optical cavities3–8 or highly anisotropic samples9. Extensions to higher dimensions that aim to exploit multimode configurations have been suggested theoretically10–16. Here, we describe a simple experiment with many spatial degrees of freedom, in which two continuous symmetries—rotation and translation in the plane orthogonal to a pump beam axis—are spontaneously broken. We observe the simultaneous long- range spatial structuring (with hexagonal symmetry) of the density of a cold atomic cloud and of the pump optical field, with adjustable length scale.

It discusses unchallenged assumptions (doxa), commitment to shared stakes (illusio), the practice to achieve these stakes (practice), and the struggle for glories and riches (capital).

These offer four types of practical outcomes: guidance for good practice; insights into emotional aspects of authorship; warnings of potentially dysfunctional practices; and a celebration of our successes.",M & A,576
D,Impurity transport studies on MAST,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/impurity-transport-studies-on-mast,"Impurity transport is a subject of fundamental importance in plasma physics in general and in tokamak physics in particular. The behaviour of the various impurity species and the evolution of their concentration determines, among other things, the fuel dilution and the fusion reaction rate, the plasma radia tion pattern and the local energy balance, the plasma effective charge and resistivity and the neutral beam particle and power deposition profile. It is therefore impor tant to develop both a sound experimental base and reliable models to interpret the experimental results and to predict the transport properties of impurities.
Time-dependent helium and methane gas puff experiments have been performed on the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST) during a two point plasma current, I p , scan in L-mode and a confinement scan at constant I p . For the I p scan, a dimensionless safety factor, q , scan was attempted by using a constant toroidal magnetic field and by moderating the beam power to match the plasma temperature. The temperature and magnetic field was also kept constant during the confinement scan to probe the effects of the electron density gradient.
An evaluation of the He II ( n = 4 → 3) and C VI ( n = 8 → 7) spectral lines, induced by active charge exchange emission and measured using the RGB 2D camera on MAST, indicate that carbon experiences moderately higher rates of diffusion and inward convection than helium in the L-mode high I p plasma. Lowering I p in L- mode caused a moderate increase in the helium diffusion and co nvection coefficients near the plasma edge. Neoclassical simulations were carrie d out which indicate anomalous rates of helium and carbon diffusion and inward convection in the outer regions of both L-mode plasmas.
Similar rates of helium diffusion are found in the H-mode plasma, however these rates are consistent with neoclassical predictions. The anomalous inward pinch found for helium in the L-mode plasmas is also not apparent in H-mode. An outward flux of helium and carbon is found at mid-radius in H-mode, corresponding the region of positive electron density gradient.
Linear gyrokinetic simulations of one flux surface in L-mode using the gs2 and gkw codes were performed which show that equilibrium flow shear is sufficient to stabilise ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes, consistent with BES observations, and suggest that collisionless trapped electron modes (TEMs) may dominate the anomalous helium particle transport. A quasilinear estimate of the dimensionless peaking factor associated with TEMs is in good agreement with experiment. Collisionless TEMs are more stable in H-mode because the electron density gradient is flatter. The steepness of this gradient is therefore pivotal in determining the inward neoclassical particle pinch and the particle flux associated with TEM turbulence.",B & C,467
A,Quantitative super-resolution imaging of Bruchpilot distinguishes active zone states,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantitative-super-resolution-imaging-of-bruchpilot-distinguishes,"The precise molecular architecture of synaptic active zones (AZs) gives rise to different structural and functional AZ states that fundamentally shape chemical neurotransmission. However, elucidating the nanoscopic protein arrangement at AZs is impeded by the diffraction-limited resolution of conventional light microscopy. Here we introduce new approaches to quantify endogenous protein organization at single-molecule resolution in situ with super-resolution imaging by direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM). Focusing on the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we find that the AZ cytomatrix (CAZ) is composed of units containing ~137 Bruchpilot (Brp) proteins, three quarters of which are organized into about 15 heptameric clusters. We test for a quantitative relationship between CAZ ultrastructure and neurotransmitter release properties by engaging Drosophila mutants and electrophysiology. Our results indicate that the precise nanoscopic organization of Brp distinguishes different physiological AZ states and link functional diversification to a heretofore unrecognized neuronal gradient of the CAZ ultrastructure.",B & C & D,457
E,Strong photonic crystal behavior in regular arrays of core-shell and quantum disc InGaN/GaN nanorod light-emitting diodes,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/strong-photonic-crystal-behavior-in-regular-arrays-of-core-shell-,"We show that arrays of emissive nanorod structures can exhibit strong photonic crystal behavior, via observations of the far-field luminescence from core-shell and quantum disc InGaN/GaN nanorods. The conditions needed for the formation of directional Bloch modes characteristic of strong photonic behavior are found to depend critically upon the vertical shape of the nanorod sidewalls. Index guiding by a region of lower volume-averaged refractive index near the base of the nanorods creates a quasi-suspended photonic crystal slab at the top of the nanorods which supports Bloch modes. Only diffractive behavior could be observed without this region. Slab waveguide modelling of the vertical structure shows that the behavioral regime of the emissive nanorod arrays depends strongly upon the optical coupling between the nanorod region and the planar layers below. The controlled crossover between the two regimes of photonic crystal operation enables the design of photonic nanorod structures formed on planar substrates that exploit either behavior depending on device requirements.",E & F,136
C,Monitoring of an esterification reaction by on-line direct liquid sampling mass spectrometry and in-line mid infrared spectrometry with an attenuated total reflectance probe,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/monitoring-of-an-esterification-reaction-by-on-line-direct-liquid,"A specially designed thermal vaporiser was used with a process mass spectrometer designed for gas analysis to monitor the esterification of butan-1-ol and acetic anhydride. The reaction was conducted at two scales: in a 150mL flask and a 1L jacketed batch reactor, with liquid delivery flow rates to the vaporiser of 0.1 and 1.0mLmin-1, respectively. Mass spectrometry measurements were made at selected ion masses, and classical least squares multivariate linear regression was used to produce concentration profiles for the reactants, products and catalyst. The extent of reaction was obtained from the butyl acetate profile and found to be 83% and 76% at 40°C and 20°C, respectively, at the 1L scale. Reactions in the 1L reactor were also monitored by in-line mid-infrared (MIR) spectrometry; off-line gas chromatography (GC) was used as a reference technique when building partial least squares (PLS) multivariate calibration models for prediction of butyl acetate concentrations from the MIR spectra. In validation experiments, good agreement was achieved between the concentration of butyl acetate obtained from in-line MIR spectra and off-line GC. In the initial few minutes of the reaction the profiles for butyl acetate derived from on-line direct liquid sampling mass spectrometry (DLSMS) differed from those of in-line MIR spectrometry owing to the 2min transfer time between the reactor and mass spectrometer. As the reaction proceeded, however, the difference between the concentration profiles became less noticeable. DLSMS had advantages over in-line MIR spectrometry as it was easier to generate concentration profiles for all the components in the reaction. Also, it was possible to detect the presence of a simulated impurity of ethanol (at levels of 2.6 and 9.1% mol/mol) in butan-1-ol, and the resulting production of ethyl acetate, by DLSMS, but not by in-line MIR spectrometry.",H & J,398

Breaking new ground on the applications of these commodity organometallics in synthesis under more environmentally friendly conditions, this work introduces deep eutetic solvents (DESs) as a green alternative media to carry out chemoselective additions of ketones in air at room temperature. Comparing their reactivities in DES with those observed in pure water suggest that a kinetic activation of the alkylating reagents is taking place, favoring nucleophilic addition over the competitive hydrolysis, which can be rationalized through formation of halide-rich magnesiate or lithiate species.",L & K & C,300

It has been found that the geometric proportions of the growth constrictions play an important role: 2.6â.Î 1/4m and 4.5â.Î 1/4m wide growth tunnels favor the evolutionary selection mechanism, contrary to the case of 8.6â.Î 1/4m growth tunnels. It was also found that GaN microcrystal ensembles are dominated by slight tensile strain irrespective of growth tunnel shape.",I & C & M,804
B,Interrogating the practice of image making in a budding context,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/interrogating-the-practice-of-image-making-in-a-budding-context,"Image making is a continuous worldwide practice of architects and designers whose concern is to create meaningful environments. Such a practice results in expressions that either reflect the regional context or mirror the wider global culture. This paper aims at interrogating image making practices in the city of Doha, which has experienced rapid urban transformations, associated with building large scale work and learning environments, mixed use developments, and cultural and sport facilities. Contextualizing current debate on Doha’s architecture and urbanism, a critical analysis of geo-cultural politics and on the notion of the 'scapes of flows' is undertaken. Based on contextual, critical, and perceptual approaches image-making practices in the city were discerned.  Different types of efforts were categorized and critically analyzed underlying the contextual and critical approaches. The analysis reveals that efforts range from utilizing symbolism in contemporary imaging, to manifesting tradition-modernity in search for image identity, to addressing the global condition towards image making. The perceptual approach established empirical evidence by investigating users' reactions to three notable office buildings that their design attempts to evoke a unique image. This was supported by statements made by CEOs of architectural firms and development companies that reflected a promise towards image making in the architecture of Doha. A concluding critique is introduced to elucidate that while there are incessant attempts at image making, the practice of 'cutting and pasting' dominates in the absence of critical consciousness. Such a critique calls for avoiding 'case by case decision making' the urban governance in the city still adopts while engaging effective place making strategies.",L,965
B,Discovery and development of organic super-electron-donors,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/discovery-and-development-of-organic-super-electron-donors,"Based on simple ideas of electron-rich alkenes, exemplified by tetrakis(dimethylamino)ethene, TDAE, and on additional driving force associated with aromatization, families of very powerful neutral organic super-electron-donors (SEDs) have been developed. In the ground state, they carry out metal-free reductions of a range of functional groups. Iodoarenes are reduced either to aryl radicals or, with stronger donors, to aryl anions. Reduction to aryl radicals allows the initiation of very efficient transition-metal-free coupling of haloarenes to arenes. The donors also reduce alkyl halides, arenesulfonamides, triflates,
and triflamdes, Weinreb amides, and acyloin derivatives. Under photoactivation at 365 nm, they are even more powerful and reductively cleave aryl chlorides. They reduce unactivated benzenes to the corresponding radical anions and display original selectivities in preferentially reducing benzenes over malonates or cyanoacetates. Additionally, they reductively cleave ArC−X, ArX−C (X = N or O) and ArC−C bonds, provided that the two resulting fragments are somewhat stabilized.",B & H,189
C,Unraveling resistive versus collisional contributions to relativistic electron beam stopping power in cold-solid and in warm-dense plasmas,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/unraveling-resistive-versus-collisional-contributions-to-relativi,"We present results on laser-driven relativistic electron beam propagation through aluminum samples, which are either solid and cold or compressed and heated by laser-induced shock. A full numerical description of fast electron generation and transport is found to reproduce the experimental absolute Kα yield and spot size measurements for varying target thicknesses, and to sequentially quantify the collisional and resistive electron stopping powers. The results demonstrate that both stopping mechanisms are enhanced in compressed Al samples and are attributed to the increase in the medium density and resistivity, respectively. For the achieved time- and space-averaged electronic current density, ⟨jh⟩∼8×1010 A/cm2 in the samples, the collisional and resistive stopping powers in warm and compressed Al are estimated to be 1.5 keV/μm and 0.8 keV/μm , respectively. By contrast, for cold and solid Al, the corresponding estimated values are 1.1 keV/μm and 0.6 keV/μm . Prospective numerical simulations involving higher jh show that the resistive stopping power can reach the same level as the collisional one. In addition to the effects of compression, the effect of the transient behavior of the resistivity of Al during relativistic electron beam transport becomes progressively more dominant, and for a significantly high current density, jh∼1012 A/cm2 , cancels the difference in the electron resistive stopping power (or the total stopping power in units of areal density) between solid and compressed samples. Analytical calculations extend the analysis up to jh=1014 A/cm2 (representative of the full-scale fast ignition scenario of inertial confinement fusion), where a very rapid transition to the Spitzer resistivity regime saturates the resistive stopping power, averaged over the electron beam duration, to values of ∼1 keV/μm .",D & L,757

A sign reversing involution on ballot matrices is defined. We show that matrices fixed under this involution are in bijection with labeled interval orders and that they decompose to a pair consisting of a permutation and an inversion table. To fully classify such pairs, results pertaining to the enumeration of permutations having a given set of ascent bottoms are given. This allows for a new formula for the number of labeled interval orders.",A & B & C & D,973

C,Robust design of LCL-filters for active damping in grid converters,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/robust-design-of-lcl-filters-for-active-damping-in-grid-converter,"Grid converters require a simple inductor or an LCL-filter to limit the current ripples. The LCL-filter is nowadays the preferred solution as it allows lower inductance values. In order to solve the stability concerns, active damping is preferred to passive damping since it does not use dissipative elements. However, large variations in the grid inductance and resonances arising from parallel converters may still compromise the system stability. This calls for a robust design of LCL-filters with active damping. This paper proposes a design flow with little iteration for two well-known methods, namely lead-lag network and current capacitor feedback. The proposed formulas for the resonance frequency, grid and converter inductance ratio, and capacitance of the LCL-filter allow calculating all the LCL-filter parameters. An estimation for the achieved Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the grid current is also provided. Experimental results show very robust designs to the parameter variations.",H,732
D,Impact of C2C Operation on DG Capacity in HV Networks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/impact-of-c2c-operation-on-dg-capacity-in-hv-networks,"The objective of the Capacity to Customers (C2C) project, an Ofgem Low Carbon Network Fund project led by Electricity North West Limited (ENWL) in conjunction with several industrial and academic partners, is to test a combination of new automation technology, non-conventional network operational practices (i.e., increased network interconnection), and commercial demand-side response (DSR) contracts. These changes will allow ENWL to increase demand and generation connections on a selection of trial circuits – representing approximately 10% of its high voltage (HV) system – without resorting to conventional reinforcement measures. The project will thereby “release” inherent spare capacity in the HV system in order to accommodate the future forecast increases in demand and DG, whilst avoiding (or deferring) the cost and environmental impacts that are associated with traditional network reinforcement.
This paper documents work undertaken by the University of Strathclyde to quantify the ability of C2C network operation to accommodate additional DG capacity. This has been achieved using simulation models based upon actual system data from a representative proportion of the C2C trial circuits.",I & J,856
E,Three-phase AC side voltage-doubling high power density voltage source converter with intrinsic buck-boost cell and common mode voltage suppression,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/three-phase-ac-side-voltage-doubling-high-power-density-voltage-s,"The three-phase two-level voltage source converter (VSC) is widely employed in power conversions between AC and DC for its four-quadrant operation and control flexibility. However, it suffers from the low output voltage range with a peak value of half DC-link per phase, which necessitates the use of either high DC-link voltage or bulky step-up transformer to enable the medium voltage operation. Additionally, the high common mode (CM) voltage between AC loads neutral points and ground may reduce the service life and reliability of electric machinery. In this paper, a three-phase AC side voltage-doubling VSC topology with intrinsic Buck-Boost cell is analyzed. By this configuration, the AC side voltage is doubled with the phase peak value equal to DC-link. That is, only half of the DC side capacitor bank is needed to generate the same output voltage. The proposed converter uses its buck-boost cell as a virtual voltage source to synthesize negative half of the output voltage by modulating its output AC phase voltage around the negative bus (which is the real zero when grounded). This permits the average CM voltage to be suppressed to zero, and loads connected to converter AC side not to withstand any DC voltage stress (reducing the insulation requirement). Modeling and control design for both rectifier and inverter modes of this converter in synchronous reference frame have been investigated to ensure a four-quadrant three-phase back-to-back system. Experimental results have verified the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed configuration and the designed control strategies.",K & L & M,456
B,Clustering methods of wind turbines and its application in short-term wind power forecasts,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/clustering-methods-of-wind-turbines-and-its-application-in-short-,"Commonly used wind power forecasts methods choose only one representative wind turbine to forecast the output power of the entire wind farm; however, this approach may reduce the forecasting accuracy. If each wind turbine in a wind farm is forecasted individually, this considerably increases the computational cost, especially for a large wind farm. In this work, a compromise approach is developed where the turbines in the wind farm are clustered and a forecast made for each cluster. Three clustering methods are evaluated: K-means; a self-organizing map (SOM); and spectral clustering (SC). At first, wind turbines in a wind farm are clustered into several groups by identifying similar characteristics of wind speed and output power. Sihouette coefficient and Hopkins statistics indices are adopted to determine the optimal cluster number which is an important parameter in cluster analysis. Next, forecasting models of the selected representative wind turbines for each cluster based on correlation analysis are established separately. A comparative study of the forecast effect is carried to determine the most effective clustering method. Results show that the short-term wind power forecasting on the basis of SOM and SC clustering are effective to forecast the output power of the entire wind farm with better accuracy, respectively, 1.67% and 1.43% than the forecasts using a single wind speed or power to represent the wind farm. Both Hopkins statistics and Sihouette coefficient are effective in choosing the optimal number of clusters. In addition, SOM with its higher forecast accuracy and SC with more efficient calculation when applied into wind power forecasts can provide guidance for the operating and dispatching of wind power. The emphasis of the paper is on the clustering methods and its effect applied in wind power forecasts but not the forecasting algorithms.",M & A,581

This paper is concerned with the consequent change to work availability and quality in the sugar and ethanol industry in the west of Sao Paulo state.  David Harvey’s concept of the spatial fix helps to link foreign investment of Brazil’s sugar and ethanol sector to emerging biofuel markets in Europe and the 2008 financial crisis, and explain implications for work creation and destruction.  The testimonies of workers cutting and transporting sugar cane, those operating or maintaining machinery inside the new mills and former cane cutters that have joined the landless movements point to paradoxical changes to work quality and precarity and lead us to question corporate claims of social responsibility.

E,Reclaiming feminist futures: co-opted and progressive politics in a neoliberal age,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/reclaiming-feminist-futures-co-opted-and-progressive-politics-in-,"This article engages with the influential narrative about the co-optation of feminism in conditions of neoliberalism put forward by prominent feminist thinkers Nancy Fraser, Hester Eisenstein and Angela McRobbie. After drawing out the twin visions of 'progressive' feminist politics that undergird this narrative — cached out in terms of either the retrieval of past socialist feminist glories or personal reinvention — we subject to critical scrutiny both the substantive claims made and the conceptual scaffolding invoked. We argue that the proleptic imaginings of all three authors, in different ways, are highly circumscribed in terms of the recommended agent, agenda and practices of progressive politics, and clouded by conceptual muddle over the meanings of 'left', 'radical' and 'progressive'. Taken together, these problems render the conclusions of Fraser, Eisenstein and McRobbie at best unconvincing and at worst dismissive of contemporary feminist efforts to challenge neoliberalism. We end the paper by disentangling and redefining left, radical and progressive and by sketching a contrasting substantive vision of progressive feminist politics enabled by this reconceptualisation.",E & F,852
C,Does it pay to play? How bargaining shapes donor participation in the funding of environmental protection,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/does-it-pay-to-play-how-bargaining-shapes-donor-participation-in-,"Multilateral funding for global environmental protection, such as biodiversity conservation, requires donor participation. When are donors willing to participate? We examine a game-theoretic model of multilateral funding for environmental projects in developing countries. Donors must first decide whether to participate in a multilateral institution. They do so in anticipation of a bargaining outcome that depends on their participation decisions. The multilateral institution then bargains with a recipient over the distribution of gains from project implementation. We find that the donors' and the recipient's vulnerability to negative environmental externalities have diverging effects on their participation behavior. As donors' vulnerability to negative externalities increases, their bargaining power decreases and fewer donors participate. But as the recipient's vulnerability increases, more donors participate because their bargaining power grows. These findings can illuminate bargaining over multilateral climate finance and inform the design of international institutions.",H & J,337

is difficult to solve numerically. Its discretization with piecewise linear finite
elements results in typically large linear systems of equations. The inherently
parallel domain decomposition methods constitute hence a promising class of
preconditioners. An essential element of these methods is a good coarse space.
Here, the Helmholtz equation presents a particular challenge, as even slight
deviations from the optimal choice can be devastating.

In this paper, we present a coarse space that is based on local eigenproblems
involving the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. Our construction is completely
automatic, ensuring good convergence rates without the need for parameter tuning.  Moreover, it naturally respects local variations in the wave number and is hence suited also for heterogeneous Helmholtz problems. The resulting method is parallel by design and its efficiency is demonstrated on 2D homogeneous and heterogeneous numerical examples.",A & D,974

Many chemical reactions are known to occur at the plasma-water interface, but contributions from each reactive species for the degradation are still not clear. This research investigated the discoloration ofmethylene blue using a specially-configured dielectric barrier discharge reactor, where the plasma was injected into the methylene blue solution through micro-holes to initiate the oxidation reactions at different pH values of 2.9, 7.1 and 11. The degradation effects from hydroxyls and ozone were determined separately by using the radical scavenger Tert-butanol. The results demonstratethat methylene blue is degraded by both ozone and reactive hydroxyl radicals,with the latter contributing up to 30% of the discoloration effect depending onsolution pH values. The yield of plasma-produced hydroxyl radicalsup to 4.6 g/kWh was achieved and the efficiency was not affected by solution pH values; the corresponding methylene blue degradation efficiency is 184 g/kWh.",F & L & B,906
A,Structural interrogation of phosphoproteome identified by mass spectrometry reveals allowed and disallowed regions of phosphoconformation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/structural-interrogation-of-phosphoproteome-identified-by-mass-sp,"High-throughput mass spectrometric (HT-MS) study is the method of choice for monitoring global changes in proteome. Data derived from these studies are meant for further validation and experimentation to discover novel biological insights. Here we evaluate use of relative solvent accessible surface area (rSASA) and DEPTH as indices to assess experimentally determined phosphorylation events deposited in PhosphoSitePlus.
Based on accessibility, we map these identifications on allowed (accessible) or disallowed (inaccessible) regions of phosphoconformation. Surprisingly a striking number of HT- MS/MS derived events (1461/5947 sites or 24.6%) are present in the disallowed region of conformation. By considering protein dynamics, autophosphorylation events and/or the sequence specificity of kinases, 13.8% of these phosphosites can be moved to the allowed region of conformation. We also demonstrate that rSASA values can be used to increase the confidence of identification of phosphorylation sites within an ambiguous MS dataset.
While MS is a stand-alone technique for the identification of vast majority of phosphorylation events, identifications within disallowed region of conformation will benefit from techniques that independently probe for phosphorylation and protein dynamics. Our studies also imply that trapping alternate protein conformations may be a viable alternative to the design of inhibitors against mutation prone drug resistance kinases.",E,768

Both the impact on the fatigue loads of the turbines and the change in energy capture when providing droop control are assessed. Three alternative strategies for providing droop control are simulated. The controller is found to be suitable for providing droop control. When providing droop control, the damage equivalent loads for the tower and for the blades change by between -0.63% and 0.14% and between -0.45% and 0.29% respectively. Energy capture is reduced by between 3.18% and 10.91% compared to normal operation, depending upon the strategy chosen to supply droop control, the wind turbine used and the wind speed distribution.",A,462

Patient-specific models, derived from image data, may allow a more clinically relevant model. However, such models require long computation times and employ internal pulmonary artery band [dint] dimension, which limits clinical application. Simpler, zero-dimensional models utilize external PAB diameters [dext] and provide rapid analysis, which may better guide intervention. This study compared 0-D and 3-D modelling from a single patient dataset and investigated the relationship dint versus dext and hemodynamic outputs of the two models. Optimum oxygen delivery defined at dint = 2 mm corresponded to dext = 3.1 mm and 3.4 mm when models were matched for cardiac output or systemic pressure, respectively. 0-D and 3-D models when matched for PAB dimension produced close equivalence of hemodynamics and ventricular energetics.

From this study we conclude that 0-D model can provide a valid alternative to 3D-multiscale in the hybrid–HLHS circulation.",G & H,657
A,Beyond national economy-wide rebound effects: an applied general equilibrium analysis incorporating international spillover effects,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/beyond-national-economy-wide-rebound-effects-an-applied-general-e,"Existing research on the phenomenon of economy-wide rebound effects from increased energy efficiency have identified the importance of trade effects determining the nature and magnitude of economywide rebound effects in national economies where efficiency improvements have occurred (e.g. Hanley et al., 2009; Van den Bergh, 2011). However, the issue of potential spillover effects on energy demand (and supply) from energy efficiency improvements in one region/nation on others have generally been neglected (Madlener and Alcott, 2009; Sorrell, 2009; Turner, 2013; Van den Bergh, 2011). This paper considers how the concept and consideration of economy-wide or 'macro-level' rebound may be extended to consider the impacts of increased energy efficiency in one country on energy use in others. While basic theoretical contributions on the issue of ‘global rebound’ have been made (e.g. Wei, 2010) and some applied studies have been conducted (e.g. Barker et al., 2009), there exist no applied macro-level rebound studies to date that attempt to fully consider and identify the types of channels through which energy efficiency increases in one region/nation may impact energy demand and supply conditions in others. This is an important knowledge gap, particularly given the global nature of energy-related climate change and the context of supra-national policy targets such as the EU 20-20-20 framework. The potential for energy efficiency policy actions taken in one country to impact energy use (and related emissions) in others implies that target setting and implementation decisions in different member states may not be regarded as independent.",I & C & M,387

While scholars have offered opposing arguments for the influence of this theory—i.e. that it either succeeds or fails to “produce” modular organizations—we show just how and how far modularity is enacted and shapes the organization, and how it may be shaped in turn. Drawing on recent advances in performativity theory we thus contribute to modularity by showing how the modular organization emerges over time as the outcome of performative struggles among competing and complementary theories and how these struggles contribute to modifying the theory and “designing” organizations. We also add to performativity by theorizing the competition between multiple theories, the emergence of unexpected consequences or “errors”, and their implications for organizational practices and boundaries.",L,392

C,Quantum trajectories and open many-body quantum systems,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantum-trajectories-and-open-many-body-quantum-systems,"The study of open quantum systems - microscopic systems exhibiting quantum coherence that are coupled to their environment - has become increasingly important in the past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.",D & L,513
A,Novel split chest tube improves post-surgical thoracic drainage,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/novel-split-chest-tube-improves-post-surgical-thoracic-drainage,"Objective: Conventional, separate mediastinal and pleural tubes are often inefficient at draining thoracic effusions.  Description: We developed a Y-shaped chest tube with split ends that divide within the thoracic cavity, permitting separate intrathoracic placement and requiring a single exit port. In this study, thoracic drainage by the split drain vs. that of separate drains was tested.  Methods: After sternotomy, pericardiotomy, and left pleurotomy, pigs were fitted with separate chest drains (n=10) or a split tube prototype (n=9) with internal openings positioned in the mediastinum and in the costodiaphragmatic recess. Separate series of experiments were conducted to test drainage of D5W or 0.58 M sucrose, an aqueous solution with viscosity approximating that of plasma. One litre of fluid was infused into the thorax, and suction was applied at -20 cm H2O for 30 min.  Results: When D5W was infused, the split drain left a residual volume of 53±99 ml (mean value ± SD) vs. 148 ± 120 for the separate drain (P = 0.007), representing a drainage efficiency (i.e. drained vol/[drained + residual vol]) of 95 ± 10% vs. 86 ± 12% for the separate drains (P = 0.011). In the second series, the split drain evacuated more 0.58 M sucrose in the first minute (967 ± 129 ml) than the separate drains (680 ± 192 ml, P<0.001). By 30 min, the split drain evacuated a similar volume of sucrose vs. the conventional drain (1089 ± 72 vs. 1056 ± 78 ml; P = 0.5). Residual volume tended to be lower (25 ± 10 vs. 62 ± 72 ml; P = 0.128) and drainage efficiency tended to be higher (98 ± 1 vs. 95 ± 6%; P = 0.111) with the split drain vs. conventional separate drains.  Conclusion: The split chest tube drained the thoracic cavity at least as effectively as conventional separate tubes.

In 89 children (42 boys, 47 girls; mean age 4.1 SD 1.3y) measures of body fatness were made using total body water (TBW), dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), air displacement plethysmography (BODPOD) and skinfold thickness. Methods were compared by Bland–Altman analysis using TBW as the reference method, and by paired comparisons and rank order correlations.  Bias for DXA was +1.8% body fat percentage units (limits of agreement +15.5% to -11.9%), bias for BODPOD was -3.5% (limits of agreement +18.9% to -5.9%) and bias for skinfolds using the Slaughter equations was -6.5% (limits of agreement +10.0% to –23.1%). Significant rank order correlations with TBW measures of fatness were obtained for DXA estimates of fatness (r=0.54, P=0.01), but not for estimates of fat by skinfold thickness (r=0.20, P=0.2) or BODPOD (r=0.25, P=0.1). Differences between both DXA and BODPOD and the reference TBW estimates of body fatness were not significant (P=0.06 and P=0.1 respectively); however, the difference in estimated body fatness between skinfold thickness and TBW was significant (P<0.001).  Estimates of body fatness in preschool children were inaccurate at the level of the individual child using all the methods, but DXA might provide unbiased estimates and a means of making relative assessments of body fatness.",H,487
D,Evaluation of a reduced mechanism for turbulent premixed combustion,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluation-of-a-reduced-mechanism-for-turbulent-premixed-combusti,"In this study, 3D direct numerical simulations of a multi-component fuel consisting of View the MathML source and CH4 reacting with air are performed. A freely propagating turbulent premixed stoichiometric flame is simulated for both low and high turbulence conditions i.e., the rms values of turbulent velocity fluctuations normalised by the laminar flame speed are of order 1 and 10. A skeletal mechanism involving 49 reactions and 15 species, and a 5-step reduced mechanism with 9 species, are used in order to evaluate the performance of the reduced mechanism under turbulent conditions. The 5-step mechanism incurs significantly lower computational expenses compared to the skeletal mechanism. The majority of species mean mass fractions and mean reaction rates computed using these two mechanisms are in good agreement with one another. The mean progress variable and heat release rate variations across the flame brush are also recovered by the reduced mechanism. No major differences are observed in flame response to curvature or strain effects induced by turbulence, although some differences are observed in instantaneous flame structure. These differences are studied using a correlation coefficient and detailed analysis suggests that this comes from the fluctuating heat release induced effects in the case with higher turbulence level. Further considerations based on instantaneous reaction rate and local displacement speed are discussed to evaluate the suitability of the reduced mechanism.",I & J,728
E,The performance of employee-owned businesses in Scotland: some preliminary empirical evidence,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-performance-of-employee-owned-businesses-in-scotland-some-pre,"In recent years, there has been a growing focus on promoting the concept of employee-ownership of businesses within public policy. One of the strong drivers of this is an assumption that these businesses out-perform conventionally structured businesses. This paper highlights some of the findings from the first empirical examination of the growth performance of employee-owned businesses (EOBs) ever undertaken in Scotland. The study involved an in-depth examination of a small sample of employee owned firms and a quasi-experimental comparison of these firms against a control group of non-employee owned firms. The study confirms that the performance of EBOs is generally superior to that of non EBOs on a number of different variables. On average, employee-owned firms both employ more staff and exhibit higher turnover growth than their peers. The results of this analysis are discussed and the policy implications arising from the study are outlined.",K & L & M,810
B,Stabilised finite element methods for a bending moment formulation of the Reissner-Mindlin plate model,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/stabilised-finite-element-methods-for-a-bending-moment-formulatio,"This work presents new stabilised finite element methods for a bending moments formulation of the Reissner-Mindlin plate model. The introduction of the bending moment as an extra unknown leads to a new weak formulation, where the symmetry of this variable is imposed strongly in the space. This weak problem is proved to be well-posed, and stabilised Galerkin schemes for its discretisation are presented and analysed. The finite element methods are such that the bending moment tensor is sought in a finite element space constituted of piecewise linear continuos and symmetric tensors. Optimal error estimates are proved, and these findings are illustrated by representative numerical experiments.",M & A,422

Generally, the reaction takes place in the ortho position, adjacent to the substituent. Here, we introduce a protocol by which the metalating agent, a disodium-monomagnesium alkyl-amide, forms a template that extends regioselectivity to more distant arene sites. Depending on the nature of the directing group, ortho-meta' or meta-meta' dimetalation is observed, in the latter case breaking the dogma of ortho metalation. This concept is elaborated through the characterization of both organometallic intermediates and electrophilically quenched products.",B & C & D,261

Microfluidics provides the tools for high-throughput single-cell functional monitoring, while gold nanorods have unique potential for intracellular tracking and can simultaneously be used as drug carriers. Presented here is a miniaturised platform that integrates these features with a multimodal approach to cell imaging. A microfluidic device allows for trapping of an array of singlecells, followed by the controlled delivery of nanoparticles into the cell array and subsequent real-time multimodal imaging of cellular interactions with functionalised nanoparticles.

D,Heuristic scheduling algorithm oriented dynamic tasks for imaging satellites,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/heuristic-scheduling-algorithm-oriented-dynamic-tasks-for-imaging,"Imaging satellite scheduling is an NP-hard problem with many complex constraints. This paper researches the scheduling problem for dynamic tasks oriented to some emergency cases. After the dynamic properties of satellite scheduling were analyzed, the optimization model is proposed in this paper. Based on the model, two heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve the problem. The first heuristic algorithm arranges new tasks by inserting or deleting them, then inserting them repeatedly according to the priority from low to high, which is named IDI algorithm. The second one called ISDR adopts four steps: insert directly, insert by shifting, insert by deleting, and reinsert the tasks deleted. Moreover, two heuristic factors, congestion degree of a time window and the overlapping degree of a task, are employed to improve the algorithm’s performance. Finally, a case is given to test the algorithms. The results show that the IDI algorithm is better than ISDR from the running time point of view while ISDR algorithm with heuristic factors is more effective with regard to algorithm performance. Moreover, the results also show that our method has good performance for the larger size of the dynamic tasks in comparison with the other two methods.",A & D,223

It is proposed to implement a pair of extended, trapezoidal shaped electric plates, which will not only resolve ion traces at high energies, but will also retain the lower energy part of the spectrum. While a longer (along the axis of the undeflected ion beam direction) electric plate design provides effective charge state separation at the high energy end of the spectrum, the proposed new trapezoidal shape will enable the low energy ions to reach the detector, which would have been clipped or blocked by simply extending the rectangular plates to enhance the electrostatic deflection.",E,515

A,Vapour deposition technologies for the fabrication of hot-forming tools: a review,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/vapour-deposition-technologies-for-the-fabrication-of-hot-forming,"This paper reports recent developments of vacuum coatings technologies for hot-forming tooling applications. Whilst well implanted in the machining and cutting industry, vacuum coatings face important challenges for the fabrication of forming tools, and more specifically in hot forming, due to the extreme operation conditions to be met, such as high loading forces, impact/thermal cycling, working material adhesion, etc. Present and future coatings adapted to hot work tooling are discussed in this paper: transition metal nitrides, carbon nitrides, borides and mixed oxides are among the currently postulated coating formulations for high temperature forming. The study is complemented with current strategies of characterizing the properties of the coatings in the adequate environment of high temperatures and contact loadings. To this aspect, a number of examples, from using standard laboratory equipment to the use of in-house developed tribological set-ups, are given, together with recent findings obtained from the authors’ research groups. The data available is, however, quite limited from the scientific literatures on the field trials with reliable, statistical relevance, which is, probably, attributed to the high costs normally incurred for carrying out experiments in real industrial environment. Nevertheless, we could still draw a conclusion of that vacuum coating for tooling applications is at a front edge of knowledge generation and technology transfer to industry, and while being already mature, there is still a needed effort for significant industrial up-take from the novel coatings developed or being under the development.",G & H,388
A,Boys and their Toys,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/boys-and-their-toys,"The Boys and their Toys project was proposed by the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) and accepted by the Digital Health & Care Institute as an Experience Lab. The Lab took place in June 2015.

The Experience Lab aimed to co-create scenarios in which digital interventions could be used as motivation to increase the level of physical activity for dads, as a means of reducing the risk of developing type-2 diabetes. We looked at how the daily life of the men taking part had changed when they became a dad, how these changes possibly influenced their level of physical activity, and what would motivate them to become more active.

The Lab provided a safe and creative environment through which the Lab team helped participants (“experienced dads”) to feel comfortable to share stories, reflect on their lives and explore their motivations. The information gathered was then used to co-create possible scenarios for ways in which digital interventions could motivate the participants to enjoy an active everyday life.

A series of activities including a physical work out, fireplace story sharing, mapping and a co-creation session were designed to gain insights into what appropriate support for dads in maintaining an active lifestyle would look like.

The outputs from the Lab included audio, photos, videos and field notes which were analysed for emerging themes.

The Experience Lab showed that a key to maintaining an active lifestyle is balancing a man’s time as a dad and his personal time, which was described as very challenging by the participants. Whether you need to sleep, go to the pub, work in the garden or go for a run, it is that time for yourself that most men feel like they must give up once they become a dad. It became apparent that the activities participants engaged in during the Lab day served as a moment to reflect on the balance of their lives. More than the solutions co-created, the greatest value was gained from the activity of reflecting and identifying different stages in their lives with accompanying behavioural changes.

It should be noted that the Lab involved a small number of participants, but that the intimate setting allowed participants to feel comfortable to share experiences on an emotional level, which made it possible to gather the qualitative insights included in our report.",I & C & M,366

B,Scotland’s Green Jobs Conundrum: How to Better Measure the Employment Impact of a Low Carbon Future,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/scotlands-green-jobs-conundrum-how-to-better-measure-the-employme,"The political ambition to turn Scotland into a low carbon economy, powered by renewable energy technologies, is driven, in part, by the belief that such a transformation will reindustrialise the country and generate tens of thousands of skilled jobs. This paper reviews Scottish energy strategy since 1999 and notes the stronger policy link in recent years between investment in low carbon and renewable energy and related employment growth. The evolution of this strategy has culminated in explicit, ambitious targets for green jobs created. However, defining low carbon and renewable employment is complex. Three recent estimates of such employment in Scotland came to quite disparate conclusions. There is an underlying problem: the current lack of appropriate disaggregation of such employment categories in the economic accounts. Were such disaggregation available, it would provide robust and reproducible measures of employment in defined activities. It would also identify the causal drivers of measured (current) employment and where these drivers lie on “temporary-long term” or “domestic-global” axes. Economic accounts, disaggregated in this way, would help demonstrate whether specific policy interventions are delivering the jobs forecast. In our view, greater conceptual clarity and a more significant allocation of resources need to be devoted to the measurement of activity and employment in low carbon and renewable activities in Scotland to allow any meaningful evaluation of strategy in this area.",B & H,633
C,Lectin-like bacteriocins from pseudomonas spp. utilise D-rhamnose containing lipopolysaccharide as a cellular receptor,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/lectin-like-bacteriocins-from-pseudomonas-spp-utilise-d-rhamnose-,"Lectin-like bacteriocins consist of tandem monocot mannose-binding domains and display a genus-specific killing activity. Here we show that pyocin L1, a novel member of this family from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, targets susceptible strains of this species through recognition of the common polysaccharide antigen (CPA) of P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide that is predominantly a homopolymer of d-rhamnose. Structural and biophysical analyses show that recognition of CPA occurs through the C-terminal carbohydrate-binding domain of pyocin L1 and that this interaction is a prerequisite for bactericidal activity. Further to this, we show that the previously described lectin-like bacteriocin putidacin L1 shows a similar carbohydrate-binding specificity, indicating that oligosaccharides containing d-rhamnose and not d-mannose, as was previously thought, are the physiologically relevant ligands for this group of bacteriocins. The widespread inclusion of d-rhamnose in the lipopolysaccharide of members of the genus Pseudomonas explains the unusual genus-specific activity of the lectin-like bacteriocins.",D & L,819
A,Numerical simulation of behavior of reinforced concrete structures considering corrosion effects on bonding,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/numerical-simulation-of-behavior-of-reinforced-concrete-structure,"Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete can alter the interface between the steel and concrete and thus affects the bond mechanism. This subsequently influences the behavior of reinforced concrete structures in terms of their safety and serviceability. The present paper attempts to develop a numerical method that can simulate the behavior of reinforced concrete walls subjected to steel corrosion in concrete as measured by their load-deflection relationship. The method accounts for the effects of corrosion on the stiffness, maximum strength, residual strength, and failure mode of the bond between the steel and concrete. In the numerical method, the corrosion-affected stiffness and maximum strength of the bond are explicitly expressed as a function of the corrosion rate. It is found in this paper that the increase in the bond strength due to minor corrosion can increase the load-bearing capacity of the wall and the corrosion-affected reinforced concrete walls exhibit less ductile behavior compared with the uncorroded walls. The paper concludes that the developed numerical method can predict the behavior of corrosion-affected reinforced concrete seawalls with reasonable accuracy.",A & B & C & D,649

C,"Retrieval-induced forgetting in repressors, defensive high anxious, high anxious and low anxious individuals",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/retrieval-induced-forgetting-in-repressors-defensive-high-anxious,"Previous research has indicated that repressors forget more negative memories which may be due to enhanced inhibitory abilities. To investigate this issue the retrieval practice paradigm was modified for use with neutral and negative personality traits. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants chose neutral and negative traits which were self descriptive and then performed retrieval practice on the neutral traits. Repressors and low anxious participants were found to demonstrate forgetting of negative traits with repressors forgetting more negative traits than low anxious participants. In Experiment 2 the inhibitory account was tested by comparing retrieval practice with re-presentation. Retrieval practice led to forgetting but re-presentation did not. In Experiment 3 forgetting of neutral traits was evident in the repressors and low anxious groups but repressors did not exhibit increased forgetting. In Experiment 4 the cue independent method was used to examine inhibition for neutral material. All groups demonstrated forgetting but repressors did not demonstrate enhanced inhibition. These findings indicate that repressors demonstrate enhanced forgetting only for self referential negative information.",H,135

At the same time, it is important to note that there is very little published research dealing with alternative forms of assessment in the field of physical education teacher education (PETE). In this paper we seek to make a case for democratic assessment practices within a critical pedagogy of PETE. We begin by outlining developments in assessment in higher education in general, before considering student participation in assessment processes. We then consider some strategies of participative assessment, and discuss their benefits, risks and difficulties. An account of the experience of the National Network of Formative and Shared Assessment in Higher Education in Spain provides us with a working example of the implementation of democratic practices in assessment in PETE. We conclude that the lack of research in physical education on democratic assessment practices raises serious questions about the extent to which our field is committed to producing teachers capable of meeting the complex social and cultural challenges they will surely meet in the schools of tomorrow.",M & A,883
D,Unplanned medication discontinuation as a potential pharmacovigilance signal: a nested young person cohort study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/unplanned-medication-discontinuation-as-a-potential-pharmacovigil,"Because of relatively small treatment numbers together with low adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting rates the timely identification of ADRs affecting children and young people is problematic. The primary objective of this study was to assess the utility of unplanned medication discontinuation as a signal for possible ADRs in children and young people.

Using orlistat as an exemplar, all orlistat prescriptions issued to patients up to 18 years of age together with patient characteristics, prescription duration, co-prescribed medicines and recorded clinical (Read) codes were identified from the Primary Care Informatics Unit database between 1st Jan 2006-30th Nov 2009. Binary logistic regression was used to assess association between characteristics and discontinuation.

During the study period, 79 patients were prescribed orlistat (81% female, median age 17 years). Unplanned medication discontinuation rates for orlistat were 52% and 77% at 1 and 3-months. Almost 20% of patients were co-prescribed an anti-depressant. One month unplanned medication discontinuation was significantly lower in the least deprived group (SIMD 1-2 compared to SIMD 9-10 OR 0.09 (95% CI0.01 - 0.83)) and those co-prescribed at least one other medication. At 3 months, discontinuation was higher in young people (≥17 yr versus, OR 3.07 (95% CI1.03 - 9.14)). Read codes were recorded for digestive, respiratory and urinary symptoms around the time of discontinuation for 24% of patients. Urinary retention was reported for 7.6% of patients.

Identification of unplanned medication discontinuation using large primary care datasets may be a useful tool for pharmacovigilance signal generation and detection of potential ADRs in children and young people.",B & C,941

E,Wide area cyclic blackout mitigation by supply-demand matching of HVAC counterpart loads,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/wide-area-cyclic-blackout-mitigation-by-supply-demand-matching-of,"Many countries around the world are challenged to meet the escalating demand for power often resulting in frequent blackouts. Domestic standby generation and associated running costs are prohibitive and novel strategies to provision measures that manage blackouts are becoming much sought after. Almost all installed standby generation is not fully utilized and certain amounts of surplus power can be identified. The paper presents a strategy that harnesses the aggregated standby superfluous power to fulfil essential demand in residential areas during cyclic blackouts covering wide areas. The solution has at its foundation, a multiagent distributed demand management system with a supply-demand matching capability. Environmental conditions are monitored periodically and power is distributed accordingly to each sub-district. Customers at sub-districts receive a share of power according to two different distribution criteria and although their immediate allocated power is not the same, their overall daily power ration is equal. Air conditioners are backed up with less power demanding counterparts and a group of options is adaptively clustered. Their usage rights are distributed among customers according to available superfluous power. The approach is evaluated through an extensive emulation framework and results show that the proposed system is capable of providing an acceptable Quality-of-Service (QoS) level during cyclic blackout periods.",E & F,198
C,The cAMP phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7) is downregulated in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells and mediates proliferation by compartmentalising cAMP at the plasma membrane of VCaP prostate cancer cells,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-camp-phosphodiesterase-4d7-pde4d7-is-downregulated-in-androge,"Isoforms of the PDE4 family of cAMP-specific phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are expressed in a cell type-dependent manner and contribute to underpinning the paradigm of intracellular cAMP signal compartmentalisation. Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression and uncover a role in controlling prostate cancer cell proliferation.  PDE4 transcripts from 19 prostate cancer cell lines and xenografts were quantified by qPCR. PDE4D7 expression was further investigated because of its significant downregulation between androgen-sensitive (AS) and androgen-insensitive (AI) samples. Western blot analysis, PDE activity assay, immunofluorescent staining and cAMP responsive FRET assays were used to investigate the sub-plasma membrane localisation of a population of PDE4D7 in VCaP (AS) and PC3 (AI) cell lines. Disruption of this localisation pattern using dominant-negative protein expression and siRNA knockdown showed that PDE4D7 acts in opposition to proliferative signalling as assessed by electrical impedance-based proliferation assays.  Here we identify the differential regulation of the PDE4D7 isoform during prostate cancer progression. PDE4D7 is highly expressed in AS cells and starkly downregulated in AI samples. The significance of this downregulation is underscored by our finding that PDE4D7 contributes a major fraction of cAMP degrading PDE activity tethered at the plasma membrane and that displacement of PDE4D7 from this compartment leads to an increase in the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. PDE4D7 mRNA expression is not, however, directly regulated by the androgen receptor signalling axis despite an overlapping genomic structure with the androgen responsive gene PART1. PDE4D7, which locates to the plasma membrane, acts to supress aberrant non-steroidal growth signals within the prostate or AS metastasis.  PDE4D7 expression is significantly downregulated between AS and AI cell phenotypes. This change in expression potentially provides a novel androgen-independent biomarker and manipulation of its activity or its expression may provide therapeutic possibilities and insights into contributory aspects of the complex molecular pathology of prostate cancer.",H & J,899

A,National Adolescent Treatment Trial for Obesity in Kuwait (NATTO): project design and results of a randomised controlled trial of a good practice approach to treatment of adolescent obesity in Kuwait,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/national-adolescent-treatment-trial-for-obesity-in-kuwait-natto-p,"Few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for the treatment of adolescent obesity have taken place outside the western world. This RCT tested whether a simple ‘good practice’ intervention for the treatment of adolescent obesity would have a greater impact on weight status and other outcomes than a referral to primary care (control) in adolescents in Kuwait City.  We report on an assessor-blinded RCT of a treatment intervention in 82 obese 10- to 14-year-olds (mean age 12.4, SD 1.2 years), randomised to a good practice treatment or primary care control group over 6 months. The good practice intervention was intended as relatively low intensity (6 hours contact over 24 weeks, group-based), aiming to change sedentary behaviour, physical activity, and diet. The primary outcome was a change in body mass index (BMI) Z score; other outcomes were changes in waist circumference and blood pressure.  The retention of subjects to follow up was acceptable (n = 31 from the intervention group, and n = 32 from the control group), but engagement with both the intervention and control treatment was poor.

B,Is experimental data quality the limiting factor in predicting the aqueous solubility of druglike molecules?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/is-experimental-data-quality-the-limiting-factor-in-predicting-th,"We report the results of testing Quantitative Structure-Property Relationships (QSPR) that were trained upon the same druglike molecules but two different sets of solubility data: (i) data ex- tracted from several different sources from the published literature, for which the experimental uncertainty is estimated to be 0.6-0.7 log S units (referred to mol/l); (ii) data measured by a sin- gle accurate experimental method (CheqSol), for which experimental uncertainty is typically < 0.05 log S units. Contrary to what might be expected, the models derived from the CheqSol experimental data are not more accurate than those derived from the “noisy” literature data. The results suggest that, at the present time, it is the deficiency of QSPR methods (algorithms and/or descriptor sets), and not, as is commonly quoted, the uncertainty in the experimen- tal measurements, which is the limiting factor in accurately predicting aqueous solubility for pharmaceutical molecules.",A,957
A,Prediction of risk of fracture in the tibia due to altered bone mineral density distribution resulting from disuse: a finite element study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/prediction-of-risk-of-fracture-in-the-tibia-due-to-altered-bone-m,"The disuse-related bone loss that results from immobilisation following injury shares characteristics with osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and the aged, with decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) leading to weakening of the bone and increased risk of fracture. The aim of the study was to use the finite element method to: (i) calculate the mechanical response of the tibia under mechanical load and (ii)  estimate the risk of fracture; comparing between two groups, an able bodied (AB) group and spinal cord injury (SCI) patients group suffering from varying degree of bone loss. The tibiae of eight male subjects with chronic SCI and those of four able-bodied (AB) age-matched controls were scanned using multi-slice peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography. Images were used to develop full three-dimensional models of the tibiae in Mimics (Materialise) and exported into Abaqus (Simulia) for calculation of stress distribution and fracture risk in response to specified loading conditions – compression, bending and torsion. The percentage of elements that exceeded a calculated value of the ultimate stress provided an estimate of the risk of fracture for each subject, which differed between SCI subjects and their controls. The differences in BMD distribution along the tibia in different subjects resulted in different regions of the bone being at high risk of fracture under set loading conditions, illustrating the benefit of creating individual material distribution models. A predictive tool can be developed based on these models, to enable clinicians to estimate the amount of loading that can be safely allowed onto the skeletal frame of individual patients who suffer from extensive musculoskeletal degeneration (including SCI, multiple sclerosis and the ageing population). The ultimate aim would be to reduce fracture occurrence in these vulnerable groups.",G & H,423
A,Impact of engine certification standards on the design requirements of More-Electric Engine electrical system architectures,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/impact-of-engine-certification-standards-on-the-design-requiremen,"The development of the More-Electric Engine (MEE) concept will see an expansion in the power levels, functionality and criticality of electrical systems within engines. However, to date, these more critical electrical systems have not been accounted for in existing engine certification standards. To begin to address this gap, this paper conducts a review of current engine certification standards in order to determine how these standards will impact on the design requirements of More-Electric Engine (MEE) electrical system architectures. The paper focuses on determining two key architectural requirements: the number of individual failures an architecture can accommodate and still remain functional and the rate at which these failures are allowed to occur. The paper concludes by proposing a comprehensive set of design requirements for MEE electrical architectures, considering various operating strategies, and demonstrates their application to example MEE electrical system architecture designs.",I & C & M,125

Combining electron channeling contrast imaging and cathodoluminescence imaging enables both the structural and luminescence properties of a sample to be investigated without structural damage to the sample. The electron channeling contrast image is very sensitive to distortions of the crystal lattice, resulting in individual threading dislocations appearing as spots with black–white contrast. Dislocations giving rise to nonradiative recombination are observed as black spots in the cathodoluminescence image. Comparison of the images from exactly the same micron-scale region of a sample demonstrates a one-to-one correlation between the presence of single threading dislocations and resolved dark spots in the cathodoluminescence image. In addition, we have also obtained an atomic force microscopy image from the same region of the sample, which confirms that both pure edge dislocations and those with a screw component (i.e., screw and mixed dislocations) act as nonradiative recombination centers for the Si-doped c-plane GaN thin film investigated.",L,529

With this goal, several genes have been identified as promising candidates to confer improved tolerance to S. cerevisiae. In most of the cases, however, the evaluation of the genetic modification was performed only in laboratory strains, that is, in strains that are known to be quite sensitive to various types of stresses. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of overexpressing genes encoding the transcription factor (YAP1) and the mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase (MCR1), either alone or in combination, in an already robust and xylose-consuming industrial strain of S. cerevisiae and evaluated the effect during the fermentation of undiluted and undetoxified spruce hydrolysate. Overexpression of either gene resulted in faster hexose catabolism, but no cumulative effect was observed with the simultaneous overexpression. The improved phenotype of MCR1 overexpression appeared to be related, at least in part, to a faster furaldehyde reduction capacity, indicating that this reductase may have a wider substrate range than previously reported. Unexpectedly a decreased xylose fermentation rate was also observed in YAP1 overexpressing strains and possible reasons behind this phenotype are discussed.",A & G,477

The Trypanosoma brucei genome contains apparent orthologues of several autophagy-related proteins including an ATG8 family. These ubiquitin-like proteins are required for autophagosome membrane formation, but our studies show that ATG8.3 is atypical. To investigate the function of other ATG proteins, RNAi compatible T. brucei were modified to function as autophagy reporter lines by expressing only either YFP-ATG8.1 or YFP-ATG8.2. In the insect procyclic lifecycle stage, independent RNAi down-regulation of ATG3 or ATG7 generated autophagy-defective mutants and confirmed a pro-survival role for autophagy in the procyclic form nutrient starvation response. Similarly, RNAi depletion of ATG5 or ATG7 in the bloodstream form disrupted autophagy, but did not impede proliferation. Further characterisation showed bloodstream form autophagy mutants retain the capacity to undergo the complex cellular remodelling that occurs during differentiation to the procyclic form and are equally susceptible to dihydroxyacetone-induced cell death as wild type parasites, not supporting a role for autophagy in this cell death mechanism. The RNAi reporter system developed, which also identified TOR1 as a negative regulator controlling YFP-ATG8.2 but not YFP-ATG8.1 autophagosome formation, will enable further targeted analysis of the mechanisms and function of autophagy in the medically relevant bloodstream form of T. brucei.",D,276

It demonstrates why and how these individuals adhere to their own cultural resources and refrain from consuming the products or daily life practices of other cultures. The analysis of interpretive interviews with twelve participants in Tehran and Karaj reveals that these individuals’ ethnocentrism is driven by three discourses of religiosity, nationalism, and patriotism. Given the fact that young Iranians’ cultural consumption practices have often been analysed with reference to their receptivity to the global cultural flow (or what generally is perceived as westernisation), findings in this study provide a counterargument stressing that religiosity, nationalism and patriotism play an important role in people’s sense of identity and preference for their own cultural practices and resources.",C,890

This paper presents a qualitative exploration of university students' experience of searching an online public access catalogue. The study investigated how students conceptualise their searching process, as well as how students understand themselves as seekers of information. Method. Following a search task, thirty-eight university students were interviewed using a qualitative, semi-structured interview design. The interviews explored students' experience of searching, conceptualised aspects of their searches, their information seeking strategies, confidence in searching, and any difficulties encountered. Analysis. The interviews were analysed using a grounded theory approach. The analysis involved iterative review and constant comparison of the transcripts, including line-by-line open coding followed by a second round of focused coding. Results. The results of the project present an emergent theory that explores a set of conceptual patterns in students' searching mental model of online systems, a typology of searchers' perceptions of their information retrieval skills (i.e., their searcher self-concept), and categorisation of types of searchers. Conclusion. With increased knowledge of how students conceptualise their search process and view themselves as seekers of information, educators and information professionals can work more effectively with students to search for the literature of their disciplines. Similarly, system designers can devise interfaces that suit students' needs.",B & E,123

A,A crisis of parliament,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-crisis-of-parliament,"In this chapter the institution of Parliament is located within the broader ideational frames of parliamentarism and parliamentary democracy in order to examine the contestability of the notion of parliamentary crisis in the UK. Various dimensions of crisis are analysed: a ‘crisis of public confidence’ in the institution of parliament; a ‘crisis of parliamentarism’ as a system of government posed by governance theories, and a ‘crisis of parliamentary representation’ rooted in attitudinal changes and reappraisals of political representation which assert the democratic legitimacy of nonelectoral representation and representative claim making. The concepts of legitimacy and legitimation are threaded through the analysis: as both are central to any understanding of the institutional purpose and standing of parliament, as well as to a conceptualisation of crisis. The argument is advanced that if there is a parliamentary crisis, or a series of interconnected crises, then it might well be that what the UK is witnessing is a conceptual crisis: a crisis that stems from the counter-positioning of established notions of representative democracy and legitimacy derived from electoral processes against countervailing conceptions of governance, democratic representation and representative claims which are not focused upon, or do not privilege, the institutional form of parliament or electoral representation.",M & I,425

Departing from the traditional linear approach to technology transfer, we build a model capturing interactions between a selected number of technology transfer channels and variables endogenous to the technology transfer process. The relationships identified in the model demonstrate that the UITT process and its impact extend well beyond the traditional scope of the university technology transfer offices. A narrow view of the process, one focused on short-term revenue maximisation principles, is inadequate due to secondary system elements that can impact technology commercialisation outcomes. The model suggests, when deciding on licensing, consulting or collaborative research agreements, universities should account for their reputation for technology transfer and R&D as key assets. We show that a technology transfer policy that relaxes licensing terms in favour of industry can have multi-path positive feedbacks on university success.",E & A,978
C,"Islamophobia and postcolonialism: continuity, Orientalism and Muslim consciousness",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/islamophobia-and-postcolonialism-continuity-orientalism-and-musli,"In this article, Meer tentatively delineates three ways in which he understands that the concept of Islamophobia is being informed by postcolonial scholarship.

The second involves translation. This is related to the first but different in that it focuses in particular on the utility of Orientalist critique for the concept of Islamophobia. The third concerns an account of Muslim consciousness, in so far as it is argued that ‘the making of Muslims’ is signalled by the emergence of the concept of Islamophobia, part, as one view has it, of a wider ‘decentring’ of the West. Meer argues that this third framing rests on terrain that is also populated by scholarship beyond the postcolonial tradition. This is because it expresses a story of how Muslims have contested and sought revisions to existing citizenship settlements, not least the ways in which approaches to anti-discrimination are configured. This is a story that is observable within imperfect liberal democratic frameworks that contain some institutional levers through which to challenge Islamophobia.",A & G,388

Scottish companies are also less likely to be involved in international acquisition activity. Company motivations for pursuing acquisition as a growth model appear to relate to speed and risk and include: securing investment, accessing skills and knowledge, expanding products and services ranges, quicker entry to new markets and being able to compete for larger contracts.

B,Discussion of “Learning from Failure of a Long Curved Veneer Wall: Structural Analysis and Repair” by Paulo B. Lourenço and Pedro Medeiros,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/discussion-of-learning-from-failure-of-a-long-curved-veneer-wall-,"The authors, in an interesting and valuable paper, describe the failure of the brick-masonry veneer façade of a multiuse public hall in Gondomar, Portugal. Damage occurred within 2 years of construction. The veneer was a single leaf of continuous brick masonry tied to a RC structural wall, forming a cavity of nominal width 0.07 m that was partly filled with foamed polyurethane. The veneer wall was 242 m in length and 15 m in height, without movement joints, and extended around most of the elliptical perimeter of the building with portions facing north, east, and south. From their site investigations and technical analysis, the authors attributed the failure primarily to effects of “the irreversible expansion of clay brick,” apparent both from cracking and from extensive out-of-plane deformation of the wall, which had widened the cavity to as much as 0.13 m. Effects were greater on parts of the wall facing south. The failure analysis made use of a power law proposed by Wilson et al. (2003) to describe how expansive strain develops in fired-clay ceramics with time. Here, the discussers comment on recent fundamental work on moisture expansion in brick, and in particular on its temperature dependence, matters of direct relevance to the paper under discussion. The discussers’ comments support and extend the conclusions of the authors, with which the discussers broadly agree.

Irreversible moisture expansion occurs as a result of slow chemical reactions between components of the fired-clay ceramic and environmental moisture (Hamilton and Hall 2012). The magnitude of the expansion varies strongly with brick mineralogy and kiln firing history, but a predictive model for expansion based on these factors does not yet exist. However, in general, highly crystalline engineering ceramics produced at high kiln temperatures expand less than low-fired ceramics with a higher amorphous content. The penalty is that high-fired ceramics tend to be more brittle and prone to cracking. It is now established that the expansive reaction continues indefinitely, although at a diminishing rate over all timescales; therefore, there is no well-defined time at which it ceases. Recent reanalysis of published data (Hall et al. 2011; Hall and Hoff 2012) shows that the equation e=at1/4 accurately describes expansion strain e over periods of time t as long as 65 years. It follows from this equation that expansive strain at 16 years is double the value at 1 year and three times the 1-year value at 81 years.

The persistence of the expansion reaction, albeit at a diminishing rate, emphasizes the need to incorporate appropriate movement joints in masonry design. The authors mention the possibility of using a “poor mortar” to accommodate some of the expansive strain. The use of weak mortars undoubtedly explains the absence of expansion damage in some much-older buildings with thick brick walls. However, the discussers consider that in thin brick veneers, such as those used in Gondomar, a weak mortar is potentially dangerous.

It is unfortunate both for design and for failure analysis that the test procedures generally used to characterize clay brick do not provide values of the expansivity a that are needed to apply the equation e=at1/4 . Accelerated steam tests, such as EN772-19 cited by the authors, are at best semiquantitative. In our view, it is essential to determine the expansivity from measurements of expansion strain made over an appropriate period of time under controlled conditions (Hall and Hoff 2012).

The discussers also draw attention to the important practical matter of the temperature dependence of the moisture expansivity (Hall et al. 2013). The fact that moisture expansion is the direct consequence of a chemical rehydroxylation reaction (Hamilton and Hall 2012) ensures that the expansivity increases notably with temperature. Available data indicate that the activation energy (which controls the temperature dependence) is about 70 kJ/mol. This means, for example, that the expansivity a of any brick material is about 60% greater at a temperature of 30°C than it is at 10°C. Thus, if a limit expansion strain (say, 1×10−3) is reached in a particular material in 50 years at 10°C, the same strain is attained in the same material in only 7 years at 30°C.

It seems likely that its strong temperature dependence explains why moisture expansion is perceived differently in different geographical regions [e.g., McNeilly (1985)] and generally receives more attention in regions with warmer climates, such as Australia, southern Asia, and Brazil. However, in any particular region, the magnitude of expansion and the associated damage within individual buildings are influenced by local temperature variations, in particular variations due to solar heat gain. In the Gondomar structure, deformation and cavity expansion were greatest in parts of the structure with a southern aspect, where the summer temperatures of the veneer are highest. The influence of aspect here is presumably exacerbated by the open situation of the building and by the insulation of the cavity where large temperature gradients might be expected. The discussers believe this large gradient acting over a thin veneer may partly explain such dramatic damage over a short period of time. A thicker brick cladding would probably fare better. Undoubtedly, there are also seasonal modulations of the expansion. The discussers have shown elsewhere how related thermal effects in the rehydroxylation of archaeological ceramics may be calculated (Hall et al. 2013).",B & L,980

A,Impact of ocean phytoplankton diversity on phosphate uptake,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/impact-of-ocean-phytoplankton-diversity-on-phosphate-uptake,"We have a limited understanding of the consequences of variations in microbial biodiversity on ocean ecosystem functioning and global biogeochemical cycles. A core process is macronutrient uptake by microorganisms, as the uptake of nutrients controls ocean CO2 fixation rates in many regions. Here, we ask whether variations in ocean phytoplankton biodiversity lead to novel functional relationships between environmental variability and phosphate (Pi) uptake. We analyzed Pi uptake capabilities and cellular allocations among phytoplankton groups and the whole community throughout the extremely Pi-depleted western North Atlantic Ocean. Pi uptake capabilities of individual populations were well described by a classic uptake function but displayed adaptive differences in uptake capabilities that depend on cell size and nutrient availability. Using an eco-evolutionary model as well as observations of in situ uptake across the region, we confirmed that differences among populations lead to previously uncharacterized relationships between ambient Pi concentrations and uptake. Supported by novel theory, this work provides a robust empirical basis for describing and understanding assimilation of limiting nutrients in the oceans. Thus, it demonstrates that microbial biodiversity, beyond cell size, is important for understanding the global cycling of nutrients.",A & G,339
D,FEM Simulation of microstructure refinement during severe deformation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/fem-simulation-of-microstructure-refinement-during-severe-deforma,"The majority of methods of severe plastic deformation (SPD) used for producing ultra-fine grained (UFG) and nano materials involve the non-uniform distribution of strains in the workpiece. To make the refinement of grains uniform, interlinked operations are used in which either the orientation of the workpiece or the type of SPD is changed in some sequence. Each operation has its own set of control parameters affecting the output result. As a result, the optimization of the total chain of operations becomes very difficult, especially taking into account that each stage of material processing comes from the previous one with a certain non-uniformity of the structure. To deal with such types of problems the capability of tracing the transformation of the microstructure and accounting for its effect on mechanical properties in finite element modeling (FEM) is required. There are a number of detailed physical models of grain refinement and texture formation, but very often they are too complicated for practical engineering simulations. The mechanics of SPD are also studied and simulated in many works, but normally it is assumed that material is uniform, isotropic and its properties don't change during deformation. In this paper a microstructurally-coupled FE model of the SPD process is proposed. The question of selection and verification of macroscopic and microscopic constitutive relations is discussed. The results of a simulation made in QForm are analyzed and compared with some initial experimental data.",H & L,739

We investigated 8 speakers with ataxic dysarthria (AD), 16 speakers with hypokinetic dysarthria (HD) as a result of Parkinson's Disease and 24 unimpaired control participants. Each participant performed a series of sentence repetitions under habitual, fast and slow speaking rate conditions. We used an algorithm to measure utterance-to-utterance spectro-temporal variation (UUV; Cummins, 2009). Speech rate and intelligibility were also measured.  UUV scores were significantly correlated with perceptually based intelligibility scores. There were significant differences in UUV between control speakers and the ataxic, but not the HD groups, presumably due to differences in intelligibility in the samples employed, and not to differences in pathology. Habitual speaking rate did not correlate with UUV scores. All speaker groups had greater UUV levels in the slow conditions compared to habitual and fast speaking rates.  UUV results are consistent with those of other variability indices and thus appear to capture motor control issues in a similar way. The results suggest that the UUV could be developed into an easy to use clinical tool that could function as a valid and reliable assessment and outcome measure.",D,696
C,Unlearning quantum information,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/unlearning-quantum-information,"Measurement can drive quantum dynamics, for example in ancilla driven quantum computation where unitary evolution is generated by measurements that extract no information. Where a measurement does reveal some information about the system, it may sometimes be possible to “unlearn” this information and restore unitary evolution through subsequent measurements. Here we analyse two methods of quantum “unlearning” and present a simplified proof of the bound on the probability of successfully applying the required correction operators. The probability of successful recovery is inversely related to the ability of the initial measurement to exclude the possibility of a state. As a consequence there exist unrecoverable measurements that provide little information gain.",C,200
E,Perth and Kinross Council Transitions within the Community Project: Evaluation Report,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/perth-and-kinross-council-transitions-within-the-community-projec,"This document reports the findings of an evaluation of the Transitions within the Community Project in Perth and Kinross (The Project). The evaluation was commissioned by Perth and Kinross Council and conducted by researchers from CELCIS at the University of Strathclyde. The Project is a change programme designed to reshape services for children and young people with Learning Disability, Additional Support Needs and Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties. The Project is a ‘preventative spend’ measure financed through around £805,000 provided through the Investment and Improvement Fund (IIF). It aims to ameliorate a projected overspend for Education and Children’s Services of around £1,000,000 per annum and annually increasing costs of around £400,000 to Housing and Community Care Services for young people transitioning to adult services. A simultaneous dual aim was to improve services by helping more young people with Learning Disability, Additional Support Needs and Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties to be part of their local community. The Evaluation is based on data and information gathered by Perth and Kinross Council over the duration of the Project; this material has been supplemented by some new interview data gathered by the researchers. As a result of this mixed approach to data collection, the evaluation has a number of strengths and limitations; these are discussed in the report.",B & E,358
D,Electronic and structural characterisation of Cu3BiS3 thin films for the absorber layer of sustainable photovoltaics,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/electronic-and-structural-characterisation-of-cusub3subbissub3sub,"Abstract Thin films of p-type Cu3BiS3 with an orthorhombic wittichenite structure, a semiconductor with high potential for thin film solar cell absorber layers, were synthesised by thermal annealing of Cu and Bi precursors, magnetron sputtered on Mo/glass substrate, with a layer of thermo-evaporated S. The elemental composition, structural and electronic properties are studied. The Raman spectrum shows four modes with the dominant peak at 292 cm-1. Photoreflectance spectra demonstrate two band gaps EgX and EgY, associated with the X and Y valence sub-bands, and their evolution with temperature. Fitting the temperature dependencies of the band-gaps gives values of 1.24 and 1.53 eV for EgX and EgY at 0 K as well as the average phonon energy. Photoluminescence spectra at 5 K reveal two bright and broad emission bands at 0.84 and 0.99 eV, which quench with an activation energy of 40 meV. The photocurrent excitation measurements demonstrate a photoresponse and suggest a direct allowed nature of the band gap.",E & F,702

C,Usefulness of intermuscular coherence and cumulant analysis in the diagnosis of postural tremor,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/usefulness-of-intermuscular-coherence-and-cumulant-analysis-in-th,"This article investigate the potential value of two advanced EMG measures as additional diagnostic measures in the polymyographic assessment of postural upper-limb tremor.  We investigated coherence as a measure of dependency between two EMG signals, and cumulant analysis to reveal patterns of synchronicity in EMG activity in muscle pairs. Eighty datasets were analyzed retrospectively, obtained from four groups: essential tremor (ET), Parkinson’s disease (PD), enhanced physiological tremor (EPT), and functional tremor (FT).  Intermuscular coherence was highest in the PD group (0.58), intermediate in FT (0.43) and ET (0.40), and weakest in EPT (0.16) (p=0.002). EPT patients could be distinguished by low coherence: coherence<0.18 in the wrist + elbow extensors differentiates EPT in this sample with a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of 84%.  Cumulant analysis showed predominantly alternating activity between wrist and elbow extensor in ET patients, while a more synchronous pattern was predominant in PD, EPT and FT (p=0.008). EMG activity in wrist and elbow flexors tended to be more synchronous in PD (p=0.059).Our results suggest that coherence and cumulant analysis may be of additional value in the diagnostic work-up of postural tremor.  These additional measures may be helpful in diagnosing difficult tremor cases.",M & I,513

Our discussion is framed around three propositions on: whether or not the stewardship role of accounting still holds; the usefulness, or otherwise, of accounting information in the valuation of high-technology investments; and assessing the value of intangible assets in the investment decision. We find that accounting no longer plays such a strong stewardship role, certainly for the venture capital investor. Further, its role in enabling investors to make decisions on how, when and how much to invest is limited. We propose that standard setters take this on board in revising reporting requirements.",B & L,362
A,Space debris collision avoidance using a three-filter sequence,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/space-debris-collision-avoidance-using-a-three-filter-sequence,"In the last few decades, the amount of space debris has dramatically increased, and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. Thus, there is a real risk that two objects in space orbiting about the Earth might collide. Consequently, an effective method for the detection of collisions is required in order to systematically prevent the creation of new space debris, or to study the evolution of the population of space debris after a collision occurs. This research is focused on objects orbiting in the exosphere - in low Earth orbits (LEOs) - because in the past decades these have produced the most serious damage. The methodology proposed in this paper consists of reducing the number of possible pairs of pieces of space debris into a shortlist of possible pairs at real risk of collision, using a filter sequence. This method is achieved by the following two procedures. First, an interpolation ephemerides table is built to compute the state of all the objects at several instants of time. Secondly, using the interpolation ephemerides table, the number of pairs at risk of collision is reduced by three filters. The first two filters are based on the geometry of the orbits and try to exclude pairs not undergoing orbit crossings, while the third filter searches for a time of coincidence. As a result, we have designed a powerful tool that can be used to avoid collisions between pieces of space debris.",E & A,233
B,Evaluation of user satisfaction using evidential reasoning-based methodology,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/evaluation-of-user-satisfaction-using-evidential-reasoning-based-,"For the sake of gaining competitive advantages, it is important to evaluate the satisfaction level of a product or service from the users' perspective. This can be done by investigating the relationship among customer attributes (customer requirements) and design attributes (product configurations). However, such relationship would be highly non-linear in nature. In this regard, many approaches have been proposed over traditional linear methods. Particularly, the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) method has been prevalently utilized in modeling such vague and complex relationship among these attributes and evaluating user satisfaction towards certain products or services. Despite the fact that the ANFIS method can explicitly model the non-linear relation among these attributes, it may be restricted if uncertain information can be observed due to subjectivity and incompleteness. To overcome these limitations, a belief rule base (BRB) approach with evidential reasoning (ER) is applied in this paper. For justification purpose, both the ANFIS and BRB methods are applied to the same case. Comparison results indicate that the BRB is capable of minimizing the human biases in evaluating user satisfaction and rectifying the inappropriateness associated with the ANFIS method. Also, the BRB method can generate more rational and informative evaluation results.",A & G,771

A,The ion channel free-electron laser with varying betatron amplitude,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-ion-channel-free-electron-laser-with-varying-betatron-amplitu,"The ion-channel laser (ICL) is an ultra-compact version of the free-electron laser (FEL), with the undulator replaced by an ion channel. Previous studies of the ICL assumed transverse momentum amplitudes which were unrealistically small for experiments. Here we show that this restriction can be removed by correctly taking into account the dependence of the resonance between oscillations and emitted field on the betatron amplitude, which must be treated as variable. The ICL model with this essential addition is described using the well-known formalism for the FEL. Analysis of the resulting scaled equations shows a realistic prospect of building a compact ICL source for fundamental wavelengths down to UV, and harmonics potentially extending to x-rays. The gain parameter ρ can attain values as high as 0.03, which permits driving an ICL with electron bunches with realistic emittance.",C,554
E,Enhancing KLM (Keystroke-Level Model) to fit touch screen mobile devices,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/enhancing-klm-keystroke-level-model-to-fit-touch-screen-mobile-de,"This short paper introduces an enhancement to the Keystroke-Level Model (KLM) by extending it with three new operators to describe interactions on mobile touchscreen devices. Based on Fitts’s Law we modelled a performance measure estimate equation for each common touch screen interaction. Three prototypes were developed to serve as a test environment in which to validate Fitts’s equations and estimate the parameters for these interactions. A total of 3090 observations were made with a total of 51 users. While the studies confirmed each interaction fitted well to Fitts’s Law for most interactions, it was noticed that Fitts’s Law does not fit well for interactions with an Index of Difficulty exceeding 4 bits, highlighting a possible maximum comfortable stretch. Based on results, the following approximate movement times for KLM are suggested: 70ms for a short untargeted swipe, 200ms for a half-screen sized zoom, and 80ms for an icon pointing from a home position. These results could be used by developers of mobile phone and tablet applications to describe tasks as a sequence of the operators used and to predict user interaction times prior to creating prototypes.",B & E,198
A,"Droplets, vapours and clouds – a new approach to capacitive transducer manufacture",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/droplets-vapours-and-clouds-a-new-approach-to-capacitive-transduc,"Capacitive ultrasonic transducers (cUT) comprise a substrate patterned with a regular array of uniformly dimensioned cavities above which a membrane is positioned. Transmission and reception of ultrasound is effected via controlled electrical or mechanical stimulus of the membrane, respectively. The dimensions of the cavity and the mechanical properties of the membrane determine the vibrational behavior of the resultant transducer. This paper employs a facile process for the micropatterning of polymer substrates for the manufacture of capacitive transducers. A positive mask of the desired cavity microstructure is deposited onto a polystyrene substrate. The substrate is then exposed to a saturated toluene vapour which is absorbed by the polystyrene causing swelling of the surface except in the areas where the droplets are situated resulting in the formation of micro-cavities at the position of each droplet. The PZFlex finite element (FE) software, deployed on custom cloud computing architecture allowing for 1000’s of simultaneous parallel simulations, has been employed to explore the potential for the use of the micropatterned substrates in the manufacture of capacitive ultrasonic transducers. This new cloud approach has facilitated reducing months of intensive FE modelling to a few days. The results have been employed to guide the optimisation of the patterning process in order to manufacture devices suited to aircoupled non-destructive testing. The paper describes the results of the finite element modelling, the optimisation of the manufacturing route and the characterisation of the resultant devices.",E & F,937
B,STAR—people-powered prioritization: a 21st-century solution to allocation headaches,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/starpeople-powered-prioritization-a-21st-century-solution-to-allo,"The aim of cost effectiveness analysis (CEA) is to inform the allocation of scarce resources. CEA is routinely used in assessing the cost-effectiveness of specific health technologies by agencies such as the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales. But there is extensive evidence that because of barriers of accessibility and acceptability, CEA has not been used by local health planners in their annual task of allocating fixed budgets to a wide range of types of health care. This paper argues that these planners can use Socio Technical Allocation of Resources (STAR) for that task. STAR builds on the principles of CEA and the practice of program budgeting and marginal analysis. STAR uses requisite models to assess the cost-effectiveness of all interventions considered for resource reallocation by explicitly applying the theory of health economics to evidence of scale, costs, and benefits, with deliberation facilitated through an interactive social process of engaging key stakeholders. In that social process, the stakeholders generate missing estimates of scale, costs, and benefits of the interventions; develop visual models of their relative cost-effectiveness; and interpret the results. We demonstrate the feasibility of STAR by showing how it was used by a local health planning agency of the English National Health Service, the Isle of Wight Primary Care Trust, to allocate a fixed budget in 2008 and 2009.",F & K,852

D,Copula based model for wind turbine power curve outlier rejection,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/copula-based-model-for-wind-turbine-power-curve-outlier-rejection,"Power curve measurements provide a conventional and effective means of assessing the performance of a wind turbine, both commercially and technically. Increasingly high wind penetration in power systems and offshore accessibility issues make it even more important to monitor the condition and performance of wind turbines based on timely and accurate wind speed and power measurements. Power curve data from Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system records, however, often contains significant measurement deviations, which are commonly produced as a consequence of wind turbine operational transitions rather than stemming from physical degradation of the plant. To use this raw data for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes is thus likely to lead to high false alarm rates which would make the actual fault detection unreliable and potentially add unnecessarily to the costs of maintenance. To this end, this paper proposes a probabilistic outlier exclusion method developed around a Copula based joint probability model. This approach has the capability of capturing the complex multivariate nonlinear relation between parameters based on their univariate marginal distributions through the use of Copula; data points that deviate significantly from the consolidated power curve can then be removed depending on this derived joint probability distribution. After data filtering in this manner, it is shown how the resulting power curves are better defined and less subject to uncertainty, whilst broadly retaining the same dominant statistical characteristics. These improved power curves make subsequent condition monitoring more effective in the reliable detection of faults.",B & L,681
C,A relationally parametric model of dependent type theory,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-relationally-parametric-model-of-dependent-type-theory,"Reynolds' theory of relational parametricity captures the invariance of polymorphically typed programs under change of data representation. Reynolds' original work exploited the typing discipline of the polymorphically typed lambda-calculus System F, but there is now considerable interest in extending relational parametricity to type systems that are richer and more expressive than that of System F.  This paper constructs parametric models of predicative and impredicative dependent type theory. The significance of our models is twofold. Firstly, in the impredicative variant we are able to deduce the existence of initial algebras for all indexed=functors. To our knowledge, ours is the first account of parametricity for dependent types that is able to lift the useful deduction of the existence of initial algebras in parametric models of System F to the dependently typed setting. Secondly, our models offer conceptual clarity by uniformly expressing relational parametricity for dependent types in terms of reflexive graphs, which allows us to unify the interpretations of types and kinds, instead of taking the relational interpretation of types as a primitive notion. Expressing our model in terms of reflexive graphs ensures that it has canonical choices for the interpretations of the standard type constructors of dependent type theory, except for the interpretation of the universe of small types, where we formulate a refined interpretation tailored for relational parametricity. Moreover, our reflexive graph model opens the door to generalisations of relational parametricity, for example to higher-dimensional relational parametricity.",E & A,747

Presently, protection settings are represented using proprietary parameters and stored in 
various file formats. This makes it very difficult for computer applications to manipulate such data directly. This paper introduces a process that translates the proprietary protection setting data into IEC 61850 standardised format and saves the data as System Configuration description Language (SCL) files. A code generation process that allows rapid implementation of the translation process is proposed. Among various applications, the paper demonstrates how such a

A good agreement is observed when our results are compared with predictions of linear stability analysis obtained by other authors. Moreover, we also analysed the influence of inertia for different contact angles and found that inertia strongly affects the growth rate of the instability when contact angles are large. By contrast, the wave number of the fastest growing mode does not show important variations with inertia. The numerical technique allows us to follow the evolution of the free surface instability until comparatively late stages, where the filament begins to break into droplets. The rupture pattern observed for several cases shows that the number of principal droplets agrees reasonably well with an estimation based on the fastest growing modes.",D,442

The algorithm is tested on forearm surface myoelectric signals occurring due to hand gestures. The novel features of the presented method are that: 1) activity detection is performed across multiple channels using few parameters and without the need for majority vote mechanisms, 2) there are no per-channel thresholds to be tuned, which makes the process of activity detection easier and simpler to implement and less prone to errors, 3) it is not necessary to measure the properties of the signal during a quiescent period before using the algorithm. The algorithm is compared to other offline single- and double-threshold activity detection methods and, for the data sets tested, it is shown to have a better overall performance with greater tolerance to the noise in the real data set used.",C,105

B,Validation of a fully integrated platform and disposable microfluidic chips enabling parallel purification of genome segments for assembly,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/validation-of-a-fully-integrated-platform-and-disposable-microflu,"Recent progress in the field of genetic engineering has opened up the door to novel synthetic biology applications. Microfluidic technology has been emphasized as a key technology to support the development of these applications. While several important synthetic biology protocols have been developed in microfluidic format, no study has yet demonstrated on-chip error control. In synthetic biology protocols, the purification phase is a critical error control process which enhances the reliability of the genome segment assembly by removing undesired oligos. In this context, we report the design and characterization of a fully integrated platform, demonstrating the purification of up to 4 genome segments in parallel, prior to their off-chip assembly. The key innovation of this platform is the decoupling control strategy which eliminates the need to integrate expensive components onto the microfluidic device, enabling lower cost, disposability and rapid operation. Unlike most microfluidic chips where fluid connector plugs are needed to connect external pumps, this approach is plug-less and the chips are simply connected to the control breadboard by clamping. Furthermore the passive chip is isolated from the active control layer thereby eliminating the risk of sample-to-sample contamination in the reusable parts. As a validation of this fully-integrated system, the parallel on-chip purification of genome segments was demonstrated with ratio of correct phenotypes after final assembly up to 20% superior to the bench controls, proving thereby the suitability of the platform for synthetic biology applications.",F & K,485

Emission lines from ions in the Be-like isoelectronic sequence can be used for reliable diagnostics of temperature and density of astrophysical and fusion plasmas over a wide range of temperatures. Surprisingly, interpolated data is all that is available for a number of astrophysically important ions.

Methods. We have carried out intermediate coupling frame transformation R-matrix calculations which include a total of 238 fine-structure levels in both the configuration interaction target and close-coupling collision expansions. These arise from the configurations 1s2 2 {s, p} nl with n = 3−7, and l = 0−4 for n ≤ 5 and l = 0−2 for n = 6,7.

Results. We obtain ordinary collision strengths and Maxwell-averaged effective collision strengths for the electron-impact excitation of all the ions of the Be-like sequence, from B+ to Zn26+. We compare with previous R-matrix calculations and interpolated values for some benchmark ions. We find good agreement for transitions n = 2−2 with previous R-matrix calculations but some disagreements with interpolated values. We also find good agreement for the most intense transitions n = 2−3 which contribute via cascade to the (n = 2) diagnostic radiating levels.",M & I,575
E,Universal surface-enhanced Raman tags: individual nanorods for measurements from the visible to the infrared (514 – 1064 nm),https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/universal-surface-enhanced-raman-tags-individual-nanorods-for-mea,"Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a promising imaging modality for use in a variety of multiplexed tracking and sensing applications in biological environments. However, the uniform production of SERS nanoparticle tags with high yield and brightness still remains a significant challenge. Here, we describe an approach based on the controlled co-adsorption of multiple dye species onto gold nanorods to create tags that can be detected across a much wider range of excitation wavelengths (514 – 1064 nm) compared to conventional approaches that typically focus on a single wavelength. This was achieved without the added complexity of nanoparticle aggregation or growing surrounding metallic shells to further enhance the surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) signal. Correlated Raman and scanning electron microscopy mapping measurements of individual tags were used to clearly demonstrate that strong and reproducible SERRS signals at high particle yields (>92 %) were readily achievable. The polyelectrolyte-wrapped nanorod-dye conjugates were also found to be highly stable as well as non-cytotoxic. To demonstrate the use of these universal tags for the multimodal optical imaging of biological specimens, confocal Raman and fluorescence maps of stained immune cells following nanoparticle uptake were acquired at several excitation wavelengths and compared with dark-field images. The ability to colocalize and track individual
optically encoded nanoparticles across a wide range of wavelengths simultaneously will enable the use of SERS alongside other imaging techniques for the real-time monitoring of cell-nanoparticle interactions.",B & L,169

B,"Making space for young lesbians in church? Intersectional sites, scripts, and sticking points",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/making-space-for-young-lesbians-in-church-intersectional-sites-sc,"This article is a case-study exploration of Christianity and sexuality in the lives of young lesbians in the United Kingdom. Religion matters as a personal and political force, but secularizing trends arguably obscure its influence on the complex convergence and intersection of personal, political, familial, and institutional realms (Brierley, 2006; Heelas and Woodhead, 2005). While the question of homosexuality has been a central focus in much discussion, highlighting around the presumed discontinuity between sexual identity and Christian identity (O’Brien, 2004), there is still a gap in terms of locating first-hand narratives of self-identified young queer Christians. Rather than assuming that these are separate and divergent paths (Wilcox, 2000), this article explores intersectional convergences and divergences, illustrating how religious participation can convey (de)legitimation within family, community and society. Such (de)legitimation is revealed in unpacking scripts of inclusion and exclusion (Taylor and Snowdon, 2014), which are (re)circulated via hetero-homo normative ideals, and perpetuated and contested in the context of intersectional Equalities legislation (Monro and Richardson, 2010). Here, we examine the highly gendered and heteronormative “role models,” “mentors,” and (familial) mediations experienced by young lesbian Christians, as intersecting public–private domains in the production of queer religious subjectivity and dis-identification.",A & G,438
C,The zigzag model of plant-microbe interactions: is it time to move on?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-zigzag-model-of-plant-microbe-interactions-is-it-time-to-move,"In 2006, Jones and Dangl proposed a simple coevolutionary model of plant–pathogen interactions, called the ‘zigzag’ model, which encompasses two branches of the plant immune system (Jones and Dangl, 2006). The first branch recognizes conserved molecules shared by many classes of microbe (pathogen-associated or microbe-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs or MAMPs), and is now called pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). The second branch recognizes and responds to virulence factors termed effectors that, in the model, serve to suppress PTI. This branch is called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The model has captured the imagination of plant pathology researchers and students alike, and has proved to be a powerful conveyor of the principal concepts in plant–pathogen interactions. Eight years on, we take a fresh look at the model to consider how well it fits its intended purpose, and how a model framework to inspire future researchers in the field of plant–microbe interactions might develop.",H & L,635

Displacement controlled quasistatic nanoindentation experiments were performed on a single crystal 4H-SiC specimen using a blunt Berkovich indenter (300 nm tip radius) at extremely fine indentation depths of 5 nm, 10 nm, 12 nm, 25 nm, 30 nm and 50 nm. Load–displacement curve obtained from the indentation experiments showed yielding or incipient plasticity in 4H-SiC typically at a shear stress of about 21 GPa (~an indentation depth of 33.8 nm) through a pop-in event. An interesting observation was that the residual depth of indent showed three distinct patterns: (i) positive depth hysteresis above 33 nm, (ii) no depth hysteresis at 12 nm, and (iii) negative depth hysteresis below 12 nm. This contrasting depth hysteresis phenomenon is hypothesized to originate due to the existence of compressive residual stresses (upto 143 MPa) induced in the specimen by the polishing process prior to the nanoindentation.",D,263

The theme of one of the Summit break-out sessions was 'Women in Enterprise'. The outcome of that session was a series of discussions and workshops between October and April with a range of organisations and female business owners to address the gender gap in entrepreneurial activity in Scotland. Led by Professor Sara Carter of Strathclyde University and the UK Enterprise Research Centre, and Jackie Brierton of Women's Enterprise Scotland, it was agreed that a Framework and action plan was needed to take forward some of the key ideas 
and activities identified as a result of these collaborations. This framework is a summary of the rationale for these workshops, and an outline of the ideas

E,Effect of heating rate on densification and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrites sintered by multiphysical fields coupling methodology,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effect-of-heating-rate-on-densification-and-magnetic-properties-o,"This work has provided a novel idea of fabricating MnZn bulk ferrite materials. MnZn ferrite powders with a composition of Zn0.8Mn0.2Fe2O4 (wt-%) were sintered under coupled multiphysical fields applied by Gleeble-1500D thermal simulation instrument. Cylindrical bulk ferrites with a diameter of 2.5 mm and a height of 2.5 mm were prepared, and the effect of heating rate on densification and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrites was studied. The results show that the densification and magnetic properties of MnZn ferrite were directly affected by the heating rates. A relative density of up to 98.5% was achieved when the heating rate of 100°C s-1 was used. Such magnetic properties as maximum energy product and remanence of MnZn ferrite sintered under coupled multiphysical fields are improved when compared to samples produced by conventional sintering. In particular, a 204.39% increase in maximum energy product is obtained. Finally, the densification mechanisms of multiphysical fields sintering method are discussed.",B & E,107
A,Detection of the motor points of the abdominal muscles,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/detection-of-the-motor-points-of-the-abdominal-muscles,"Abdominal functional electrical stimulation (AFES) is a technique intended to improve respiratory function in tetraplegia where breathing is affected due to abdominal muscle paralysis. Although it is known that optimal muscle contraction is achieved when electrical stimulation is applied close to the muscle motor point, AFES studies have used a variety of electrode positions. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation to detect the motor points of the abdominal muscles, and to evaluate the intrasubject repeatability and intersubject uniformity of their positions, to find the most suitable AFES electrode location.  Low frequency stimulation (0.5 Hz) was applied to the abdominal muscles of 10 able bodied and five tetraplegic participants. The electrode positions which achieved the strongest muscle contractions were recorded as the motor point positions, with measurements repeated once. For five able bodied participants, assessments were repeated after 18 months, in seated and supine positions.  Intersubject uniformity ranged from 2.8 to 8.8 %. Motor point positions were identified with intrasubject repeatability of <1.7 cm, deemed adequate relative to standard AFES electrode size. Intrasubject repeatability shows motor point positions changed little (<1.7 cm) after 18 months but varied between seated and supine positions with repeatability of up to 3.1 cm.  A simple technique to locate the motor points of the abdominal muscles is presented and shown to have an adequate intrasubject repeatability, enabling the optimum AFES electrode location to be identified for each user.",E & F,772

B,Reliability comparison of DFIG drive train configuration with PMG drive train configuration in the first 5 years of operation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/reliability-comparison-of-dfig-drive-train-configuration-with-pmg,"Modern wind turbines vary greatly in their drive train configurations. With the variety of options available it can be difficult to determine which type is most suitable for on and offshore applications. A large percentage of modern drive trains consist of either doubly fed induction generators with partially rated converters or permanent magnet generators with fully rated converters. These configurations were the focus of this empirical reliability comparison. The turbine population for the analysis contained over 1800 doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) turbines and 400 permanent magnet generator (PMG) fully rated converter (FRC) turbines. The findings of this analysis show that, due to the poorer reliability of the FRC, the DFIG configuration proved the most reliable.",M & I,800

These large structures are mainly fabricated of welded steel tubular and plate sections not dissimilar to structural details commonly encountered in the ship, and offshore oil and gas sectors, but design requirements differ significantly due to environmental aspects, loading regime and low capital expenditure and operational expenditure requirements. There is therefore a requirement to quickly update corrosion fatigue knowledge and data bases in order to assist operations and designers to optimise structures with respect to fatigue strength and cost.

This provides limited information to the assessor as these images are static.. The aim of this study was to assess whether the use of digital video was a valid assessment tool and to compare its use against photography. 35 patients post-reconstruction underwent photography, digital video capture and completed Breast Cancer Treatment Outcomes Scale (BCTOS) questionnaires. The photographs/video clips were randomised and shown to a 21 member panel. Opinions on aesthetic aspects of the reconstruction were assessed using the BCTOS and Harris scale. Panel inter-rater agreement and patient-panel correlation was assessed using Kendall's Coefficient of Concordance and Spearman's rank correlation tests respectively. There was a ""moderate"" degree of inter-rater agreement amongst panel members in all categories. Greater agreement occurred using video footage to assess overall cosmesis (0.548 vs 0.507) and shape (0.505 vs 0.486). Video showed a greater degree of correlation with patient self-assessment scores in comparison to photography (0.311 vs 0.281). Video footage coupled with panel assessment is a valid method of assessing post-operative outcomes of breast reconstruction and appears superior to still photographs in terms of inter-rater agreement and correlation with patient self-assessment.",D,203
C,Quasi two-level operation of modular multilevel converter for use in a high-power DC transformer with DC fault isolation capability,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quasi-two-level-operation-of-modular-multilevel-converter-for-use,"DC fault protection is one challenge impeding the development of multi-terminal DC grids. The absence of manufacturing and operational standards has led to many point-to-point HVDC links built at different voltage levels, which creates another challenge. Therefore, the issues of voltage matching and DC fault isolation are undergoing extensive research and are addressed in this paper. A quasi two-level operating mode of the modular multilevel converter is proposed, where the converter generates a square wave with controllable dv/dt by employing the cell voltages to create transient intermediate voltage levels. Cell capacitance requirements diminish and the footprint of the converter is reduced. The common-mode DC component in the arm currents is not present in the proposed operating mode. The converter is proposed as the core of a DC to DC transformer where two converters operating in the proposed mode are coupled by an AC transformer for voltage matching and galvanic isolation. The proposed DC transformer is shown to be suitable for high-voltage high-power applications due to the low switching frequency, high efficiency, modularity, and reliability. The DC transformer facilitates DC voltage regulation and near instant isolation of DC faults within its protection zone. Analysis and simulations confirm these capabilities in a system-oriented approach.",C,476
E,Structural and optical properties of Ga auto-incorporated InAlN epilayers,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/structural-and-optical-properties-of-ga-auto-incorporated-inaln-e,InAlN epilayers deposited on thick GaN buffer layers grown by metalorganic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) revealed an auto-incorporation of Ga when analysed by wavelength dispersive x-ray (WDX) spectroscopy and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). Samples were grown under similar conditions with the change in reactor flow rate resulting in varying Ga contents of 12-24%. The increase in flow rate from 8000 to 24 000 sccm suppressed the Ga auto-incorporation which suggests that the likely cause is from residual Ga left behind from previous growth runs. The luminescence properties of the resultant InAlGaN layers were investigated using cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements.,B & E,862

B,Cascading ecological effects of eliminating fishery discards,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cascading-ecological-effects-of-eliminating-fishery-discards,"Discarding by fisheries is perceived as contrary to responsible harvesting. Legislation seeking to end the practice is being introduced in many jurisdictions. But, discarded fish are food for a range of scavenging species so ending discarding may have ecological consequences. Here we investigate the sensitivity of ecological effects to discarding policies using an ecosystem model of the North Sea - a region where 30-40% of trawled fish catch is currently discarded. We show that landing the entire catch whilst fishing as usual has conservation penalties for seabirds, marine mammals and seabed fauna, and no benefit to fish stocks. However, combining landing obligations with changes in fishing practices to limit the capture of unwanted fish results in trophic cascades that can benefit birds, mammals and most fish stocks. Our results highlight the importance of considering the broader ecosystem consequences of fishery management policy, since species interactions may dissipate or negate intended benefits.",F & K,511

Hyperspectral data is obtained from the APEX sensor in 286 spectral bands. LiDAR data has been acquired with a TopoSys sensor Harrier 56 at full waveform. Conﬁrming previous research [1], it has been found that airborne LiDAR data, when combined with hyperspectral data, can improve classiﬁcation results. The novelty of this study is in the quantiﬁcation of the contribution of the individual data sources and their derived parameters.

E,Association between parent-infant interactions in infancy and disruptive behaviour disorders at age seven: a nested case-control ALSPAC study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/association-between-parent-infant-interactions-in-infancy-and-dis,"Effective early intervention to prevent oppositional/conduct disorders requires early identification of children at risk. Patterns of parent-child interaction may predict oppositional/conduct disorders but large community-based prospective studies are needed to evaluate this possibility. 
We sought to examine whether the Mellow Parenting Observational System (MPOS) used to assess parent-infant interactions at one year was associated with psychopathology at age 7. The MPOS assesses positive and negative interactions between parent and child. It examines six dimensions: anticipation of child’s needs, responsiveness, autonomy, cooperation, containment of child distress, and control/conflict; these are summed to produce measures of total positive and negative interactions. We examined videos from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) sub-cohort who attended the ‘Children in Focus’ clinic at one year of age. Our sample comprised 180 videos of parent-infant interaction: 60 from infants who received a psychiatric diagnostic categorisation at seven years and 120 randomly selected controls who were group-matched on sex. 
A negative association between positive interactions and oppositional/conduct disorders was found. With the exception of pervasive developmental disorders (autism), an increase of one positive interaction per minute predicted a 15% (95% CI: 4% to 26%) reduction in the odds of the infant being case diagnosed. There was no statistically significant relationship between negative parenting interactions and oppositional/conduct disorders, although negative interactions were rarely observed in this setting. 
The Mellow Parenting Observation System, specifically low scores for positive parenting interactions (such as Responsiveness which encompasses parental warmth towards the infant), predicted later psychiatric diagnostic categorisation of oppositional/conduct disorders.",B & L,662

Hospital pharmacies dispense 80% of medicines in China, accounting for 46% of total hospital expenditure. Principal measures to moderate drug expenditure growth include pricing initiatives as limited demand-side measures. Objective: Assess current utilization and expenditure including traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) between 2006 and 2012. Methods: Uncontrolled retrospective study of medicines to treat cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases in one of the largest hospitals in southwest China. Results: Utilization increased 3.3-fold for cerebrovascular medicines, greatest for TCMs, with expenditure increasing 4.85-fold. Low prices for generics were seen, similar to Europe. However, there was variable utilization of generics at 29-31% of total product volumes in recent years. There continued to be irrationality in prescribing with high use of TCMs, and the utilization of different medicines dropping significantly once they achieved low prices. Conclusion: Prices still have an appreciable impact on utilization in China. Potential measures similar to those implemented among western European countries could improve prescribing rationality and conserve resources.",H & L,138
D,A graph-based signal processing approach for low-rate energy disaggregation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-graph-based-signal-processing-approach-for-low-rate-energy-disa,"Graph-based signal processing (GSP) is an emerging field that is based on representing a dataset using a discrete signal indexed by a graph. Inspired by the recent success of GSP in image processing and signal filtering, in this paper, we demonstrate how GSP can be applied to non-intrusive appliance load monitoring (NALM) due to smoothness of appliance load signatures. NALM refers to disaggregating total energy consumption in the house down to individual appliances used. At low sampling rates, in the order of minutes, NALM is a difficult problem, due to significant random noise, unknown base load, many household appliances that have similar power signatures, and the fact that most domestic appliances (for example, microwave, toaster), have usual operation of just over a minute. In this paper, we proposed a different NALM approach to more traditional approaches, by representing the dataset of active power signatures using a graph signal. We develop a regularization on graph approach where by maximizing smoothness of the underlying graph signal, we are able to perform disaggregation. Simulation results using publicly available REDD dataset demonstrate potential of the GSP for energy disaggregation and competitive performance with respect to more complex Hidden Markov Model-based approaches.",D,216
A,Approximate closed-form solution for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/approximate-closed-form-solution-for-solar-sail-spiral-trajectori,"Solar sails have long been considered as a means of enabling new high-energy missions, such as solar polar orbiter, planetary sample return and heliopause probes, along with families of highly non-Keplerian orbits for space weather and Earth observation missions, as reviewed in Refs 1 and 2.  While most prior
analysis of solar sail orbital dynamics assumes that the optical properties
of the sail are time-invariant, it is expected that the sail membrane will slowly degrade due to cumulative, long-term exposure to solar radiation. The effect of such degradation was investigated in some detail by Dachwald and co-workers through a combination of modelling and numerical optimization. 3,4.  As expected, it was found that degradation has an impact on the trip time
of solar sails to target orbits and the ability of solar sails to realize non-Keplerian orbits.  In this Note, an approximate closed-form solution is presented for solar sail spiral trajectories with sail degradation. Since exposure to the space environment is cumulative, the impact of degradation on the sail thrust magnitude forms an integral function over the spiral duration. The time evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory is therefore described by an integro-differential equation, which for this problem does not apparently possess an explicit closed-form solution. However, it is possible to obtain an implicit
solution to the problem which provides an approximate representation of the
evolution of the solar sail spiral trajectory. This allows an initial estimation of the impact of sail degradation on mission performance to be made.
Limits are also found which bound the motion of the solar sail to an annulus, whose inner and outer radii are defined by the sail degradation rate. These limits correspond to the asymptotic behaviour of the solar sail where the sail
becomes completely absorbing, the transverse component of sail thrust vanishes and the spiral terminates. In addition, it is shown that the optimal fixed sail pitch angle required to maximize the inner and outer radius of the annulus differs from the usual sail pitch angle which maximizes the transverse component of sail thrust.  For a solar sail subject to degradation, the optimum fixed sail pitch angle must trade-off maximising the transverse component of sail thrust while minimising the projected sail area exposed to solar radiation.
Finally, while these asymptotic limits of motion represent an operational constraint, they could in principle be used as a means of enabling entirely
passive orbit transfer. For example, a small, low cost solar sail with a passively
fixed pitch angle could deliver a payload onto a quasi-circular spiral
trajectory. If the sail film is engineered to degrade at a certain rate, the asymptotic orbit the sail winds onto can then be chosen a priori. The solar sail will then perform a near circle-to-circle transfer, in principle satisfying a simple two-point boundary value problem, but using only a passively fixed sail pitch angle. Such a mode of transfer could be used to deliver payloads to given
heliocentric orbits, for example for space physics applications.",C,673
E,Pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique for optical OFDM communication systems,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/pilot-assisted-papr-reduction-technique-for-optical-ofdm-communic,"This paper investigates the use of a pilot signal in reducing the electrical peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) intensitymodulated optical wireless communication system. The phase of
the pilot signal is chosen based on the selected mapping (SLM) algorithm while the maximum likelihood criterion is used to estimate the pilot signal at the receiver. Bit error rate (BER) performance of the pilot-assisted optical OFDM system is identical to that of the basic optical OFDM (with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented) at the desired BER of less than 10−3 needed to establish a reliable communication link. The pilot-assisted PAPR reduction technique results in higher reduction in PAPR for high order (M >4) constellations than the classical SLM. With respect to a basic OFDM system, with no pilot and no PAPR reduction technique implemented, a pilot-assisted M-QAM optical OFDM system is capable of reducing the electrical PAPR by over about 2.5 dB at a modest complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) point of 10−4 forM = 64. Greater reductions in PAPR are possible at lower values of CCDF with no degradation to the system’s error performance. Clipping the time domain signal at both ends mildly (at 25 times the signal variance level) results in a PAPR reduction of about 6.3 dB at the same CCDF of 10−4 but with an error floor of about 3 × 10−5 . Although it is possible to attain any desired level of electrical PAPR reduction with signal clipping, this will be at a cost of deterioration in the systems’s bit error performance.",B & E,254
A,Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase identified as a key enzyme in erythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum carbon metabolism,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/phosphoenolpyruvate-carboxylase-identified-as-a-key-enzyme-in-ery,"Phospoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is absent from humans but encoded in the Plasmodium falciparum genome, suggesting that PEPC has a parasite-specific function. To investigate its importance in P. falciparum, we generated a pepc null mutant (D10Δpepc), which was only achievable when malate, a reduction product of oxaloacetate, was added to the growth medium. D10Δpepc had a severe growth defect in vitro, which was partially reversed by addition of malate or fumarate, suggesting that pepc may be essential in vivo. Targeted metabolomics using 13C-U-D-glucose and 13C-bicarbonate showed that the conversion of glycolytically-derived PEP into malate, fumarate, aspartate and citrate was abolished in D10Δpepc and that pentose phosphate pathway metabolites and glycerol 3-phosphate were present at increased levels. In contrast, metabolism of the carbon skeleton of 13C,15N-U-glutamine was similar in both parasite lines, although the flux was lower in D10Δpepc; it also confirmed the operation of a complete forward TCA cycle in the wild type parasite. Overall, these data confirm the CO2 fixing activity of PEPC and suggest that it provides metabolites essential for TCA cycle anaplerosis and the maintenance of cytosolic and mitochondrial redox balance. Moreover, these findings imply that PEPC may be an exploitable target for future drug discovery.",E & F,472

Drawing on social exchange theory, we propose that the effect of perceived organizational support (POS) on OID is stronger for employees with stronger exchange ideology. We further argue that employee investment in an organization may also create a social exchange process that positively influences OID. We expect that employee investment moderates not only the effect of POS on OID, but also the enhancing effect of exchange ideology on the effect of POS on OID. Specifically, POS has a stronger positive effect on OID when exchange ideology is high and when employee investment is low. When employee investment is high, POS has a weaker effect on OID regardless of employees’ exchange ideology. These effects were empirically supported by a survey. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.",B & L,132

Methods Baseline data from 113 participants with insomnia were explored to establish rates of and associations between clinical levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression across the sample. Effects of CBT-I on this symptom cluster were also explored by examining changes in pre-treatment to post-treatment levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression. Results At baseline, the most common symptom presentation was insomnia+fatigue, and 30% of the sample reported at least three co-morbid symptoms. Post-CBT, the number of those experiencing clinical insomnia and clinical fatigue decreased. There were no changes in anxiety rates from baseline to post-treatment in the CBT group and modest reductions in rates of those with clinical depression. Seven individuals (9.6%) from the CBT group were completely symptom free at post-treatment compared with 0% from the treatment as usual condition. Chi-square analysis revealed a significant relationship between group allocation and changes in symptoms of insomnia and fatigue. No such relationship was found between group allocation and mood variables. Conclusions These findings confirm the high rate of symptom co-morbidities among cancer patients and highlight strong associations between sleep and fatigue. CBT-I appears to offer generalised benefit to the symptom cluster as a whole and, specifically, is effective in reducing fatigue, which exceeded clinical cut-offs prior to implementation of the intervention. This has implications for the diagnosis/management of common symptoms in cancer patients.",E & A,151

D,Pressure dependent network water quality modelling,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/pressure-dependent-network-water-quality-modelling,"Water quality models are increasingly being used routinely to help ascertain the quality of water in drinking water distribution systems for design and operational management purposes. Conventional water quality models are demand driven and consequently do not incorporate the effects of any deficiency in pressure on the water quality throughout the distribution network. This paper assesses a new integrated pressure dependent hydraulic and water quality model. The model is an extension of the well-known EPANET 2 model that has an embedded logistic pressure dependent nodal flow function. Hydraulic and water quality analyses based on two water supply zones in the UK were conducted for a range of simulated operating conditions including normal and subnormal pressure and pipe closures. It is shown that operating conditions with subnormal pressures, if severe and protracted, can lead to spatial and temporal distributions of the water age and concentrations of chlorine and disinfection by-products that are significantly different from operating conditions in which the pressure is satisfactory. The results here may be indicative of modelling errors that may not have been recognised explicitly hitherto.",H & L,811
B,Energy efficient segmentation-link strategies for transparent IP over WDM core networks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/energy-efficient-segmentation-link-strategies-for-transparent-ip-,"Recent developments in Optical IP networks have heightened the need for reduction on power consumption via so called green photonics and concepts known as green networking. Adhering to these principles we proposed a novel energy savings approach which can be applied to optical IP networks and is based on so called ""hibernation mode with segmentation link"" technique. The hibernation mode technique is designed to help to reduce power consumption by sleep the network links and can help to optimise network overall energy usage by taking advantage of the hibernation algorithms we have developed. The proper implementation over the network infrastructure will save energy, operating cost to network operators, and while at the same time will also deliver reduced carbon footprint. In this paper, we show design model for developing energy efficient Segment-Link approach. In this scheme, the improvised energy saving techniques focus on selective sleeping of optical core fibre links, following which the Routing Wavelength Assignment algorithm based on GMPLS control plane are investigated. Simulation models and results for the proposed scheme are evaluated in both the fibre link only and segmentation-link schemes scenarios. The results shows that a significant amount of energy can be saved if appropriate ""segmentation-link"" mechanisms using optical bypass and traffic grooming is invoked.",D,998
C,The impact of a bodyweight and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) initiated through a national colorectal cancer screening programme: randomised controlled trial,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-impact-of-a-bodyweight-and-physical-activity-intervention-bew,"Objective: To evaluate the impact of a diet and physical activity intervention (BeWEL) on weight change in people with a body mass index >25 weight (kg)/height (m)2 at increased risk of colorectal cancer and other obesity related comorbidities. Design: Multicentre, parallel group, randomised controlled trial. Setting: Four Scottish National Health Service health boards. Participants 329 overweight or obese adults (aged 50 to 74 years) who had undergone colonoscopy after a positive faecal occult blood test result, as part of the national bowel screening programme, and had a diagnosis of adenoma confirmed by histopathology. 163 were randomised to intervention and 166 to control. Intervention: Participants were randomised to a control group (weight loss booklet only) or 12 month intervention group (three face to face visits with a lifestyle counsellor plus monthly 15 minute telephone calls). A goal of 7% reduction in body weight was set and participants received a personalised energy prescription (2508 kJ (600 kcal) below that required for weight maintenance) and bodyweight scales. Motivational interviewing techniques explored self assessed confidence, ambivalence, and personal values concerning weight. Behavioural strategies included goal setting, identifying intentions of implementation, self monitoring of body weight, and counsellor feedback about reported diet, physical activity, and weight change. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was weight change over 12 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting cardiovascular biomarkers, and glucose metabolism variables, physical activity, diet, and alcohol consumption. Results: At 12 months, data on the primary outcome were available for 148 (91%) participants in the intervention group and 157 (95%) in the control group. Mean weight loss was 3.50 kg (SD 4.91) (95% confidence interval 2.70 to 4.30) in the intervention group compared with 0.78 kg (SD 3.77) (0.19 to 1.38) in the control group. The group difference was 2.69 kg (95% confidence interval 1.70 to 3.67). Differences between groups were significant for waist circumference, body mass index, blood pressure, blood glucose level, diet, and physical activity. No reported adverse events were considered to be related to trial participation. Conclusions: Significant weight loss can be achieved by a diet and physical activity intervention initiated within a national colorectal cancer screening programme, offering considerable potential for risk reduction of disease in older adults.",C,409

Turning to the most recent evidence on regional disparities within countries, it is clear that challenges remain, both for the Euro area and the UK. In the case of the UK, recent evidence on regional disparities in house prices present a challenge for the Bank of England and its Financial Policy Committee and are

D,A multivariate data analysis approach towards vibration analysis and vibration-based damage assessment: application for delamination detection in composite materials,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-multivariate-data-analysis-approach-towards-vibration-analysis-,"This paper introduces a novel methodology for structural vibration analysis and vibration-based monitoring which utilises a special type of Principal Components Analysis (PCA), known as Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). In this study the methodology is introduced and demonstrated for the purposes of damage assessment in structures using their free decay response. The method's damage assessment properties are first demonstrated on a numerical example for a two degree-of-freedom (2DOF) spring-mass and damper system with non-linear stiffness. The method is then applied to an experimental case study of a composite laminate beam. The method is based on the decomposition of the frequency domain structural variation response using new variables, the Principal Components (PCs). Only a certain number of the new variables are used to approximate the original vibration signal with very good accuracy. The presented results demonstrate the potential of the method for vibration based signal reconstruction and damage diagnosis. The healthy and the different damaged scenarios are clearly distinguishable in the new space of only two reconstructed components where a strong clustering efect is observed.",E & F,195

Square billets were processed using different routes of I-ECAP at temperatures varying from 125 °C to 250 °C. The billets were obtained from commercially available coarse-grained, hot-extruded rod and fine-grained, hot-rolled plate. A strong influence of the initial microstructure on processing temperature was reported. Fine-grained samples were successfully processed at 200 °C, while coarse-grained ones must have been heated up to 250 °C to avoid fracture. A gradual temperature decrease with subsequent passes allowed successful pressing at 150 °C. Processing using various routes of I-ECAP showed that a billet rotation before the last pass had strong influence on mechanical properties. The results of experiments were plotted on the diagram of allowable processing temperature for AZ31B. It was found that the relation between the minimum temperature in I-ECAP and the initial grain size could be described by a logarithmic equation.",M & I,644

However, no systematic investigation has been carried out with regard to the optimisation of mobile phase characteristics. In this study using 223 metabolite standards, we explored the retention mechanisms on three zwitterionic columns with varied mobile phase composition, demonstrated the interference from poor chromatographic peak shapes on the output of data extraction, and assessed the quality of chromatographic signals and the separation of isomers under each LC condition. As expected, on the ZIC-cHILIC column the acidic metabolites showed improved chromatographic performance at low pH which can be attributed to the opposite arrangement of the permanently charged groups on this column in comparison with the ZIC-HILIC column. Using extracts from the protozoan parasite Leishmania, we compared the numbers of repeatedly detected LC-HRMS features under different LC conditions with putative identification of metabolites not amongst the standards being based on accurate mass (±3ppm). Besides column chemistry, the pH of the mobile phase plays a key role in not only determining the retention mechanisms of solutes but also the output of the LC-HRMS data processing. Fast evaporation of ammonium carbonate produced less ion suppression in ESI source and consequently improved the detectability of the metabolites in low abundance in comparison with other ammonium salts. Our results show that the combination of a ZIC-pHILIC column with an ammonium carbonate mobile phase, pH 9.2, at 20mM in the aqueous phase or 10mM in both aqueous and organic mobile phase components, provided the most suitable LC conditions for LC-HRMS-based untargeted metabolite profiling of Leishmania parasite extracts.

We argue for the benefits of an alternative method that views uncertainty as originating from indeterminism. We develop and illustrate an ‘antifragile’ approach to preparing for the future and present it as a step-by-step, non-deterministic methodology that can be used as a replacement for, or as a complement to, the causally-focused approach of scenario planning.",A & G,963

Here, the fundamental underlying electrical and optical aspects of high-resolution current aperturing are investigated theoretically. The most critical parameter for the possible resolution is the thickness d of the p-GaN layer, but the interplay of p-GaN resistivity and electrical junction characteristics is also important. A spatial resolution of 1.59d can in principle be achieved, corresponding to about 300 nm in typical epitaxial structures. Furthermore, the emission from such a small emitter will spread by about 600 nm while propagating through the p-GaN. Both values can be reduced by reducing d.",D,442
A,Quantum spin dimers from chiral dissipation in cold-atom chains,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantum-spin-dimers-from-chiral-dissipation-in-cold-atom-chains,"We consider the nonequilibrium dynamics of a driven dissipative spin chain with chiral coupling to a one-dimensional (1D) bosonic bath, and its atomic implementation with a two-species mixture of cold quantum gases. The reservoir is represented by a spin-orbit coupled 1D quasicondensate of atoms in a magnetized phase, while the spins are identified with motional states of a separate species of atoms in an optical lattice. The chirality of reservoir excitations allows the spins to couple differently to left- and right-moving modes, which in our atomic setup can be tuned from bidirectional to purely unidirectional. Remarkably, this leads to a pure steady state in which pairs of neighboring spins form dimers that decouple from the remainder of the chain. Our results also apply to current experiments with two-level emitters coupled to photonic waveguides.",C,958

C,Structured covariance principal component analysis for real-time onsite feature extraction and dimensionality reduction in hyperspectral imaging,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/structured-covariance-principal-component-analysis-for-real-time-,"Presented in a 3-D structure called hypercube, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) suffers from large volume of data and high computational cost for data analysis. To overcome such drawbacks, principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. However, a severe bottleneck is how to compute the PCA covariance matrix efficiently and avoid computational difficulties, especially when the spatial dimension of the hypercube is large. In this paper, structured covariance PCA (SC-PCA) is proposed for fast computation of the covariance matrix. In line with how spectral data is acquired in either the push-broom or tunable filter way, different implementation schemes of SC-PCA are presented. As the proposed SC-PCA can determine the covariance matrix from partial covariance matrices in parallel even without deducting the mean vector in prior, it facilitates real-time data analysis whilst the hypercube is acquired. This has significantly reduced the scale of required memory and also allows efficient onsite feature extraction and data reduction to benefit subsequent tasks in coding/compression, transmission, and analytics of hyperspectral data.",E & A,647
A,Assessing the impact of derived behaviour information on customer attrition in the financial service industry,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/assessing-the-impact-of-derived-behaviour-information-on-customer,"The value of the customer has been widely recognized in terms of financial planning and efficient resource allocation including the financial service industry. Previous studies have shown that directly observable information can be used in order to make reasonable predictions of customer attrition probabilities. However, these studies do not take full account of customer behavior information. In this paper, we demonstrate that efficient use of information can add value to financial services industry and improve the prediction of customer attrition. To achieve this, we apply an orthogonal polynomial approximation analysis to derive unobservable information, which is then used as explanatory variables in a probit–hazard rate model. Our results show that derived information can help our understanding of customer attrition behavior and give better predictions. We conclude that both researchers and the financial service industry should gather and use derived financial information in addition to directly observable information.",A & B & C & D,849
B,An approach for the robust design of the power systems of small satellites,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-approach-for-the-robust-design-of-the-power-systems-of-small-s,"The paper presents an approach to Robust Model-Based System Engineering (RMBSE) applied to the design of the power system of a small-satellite. Tow simple low-fidelity parametric models of the power and telecommunication systems are used to compute the mass and power requirements for different orbital geometries. The low model fidelity implies that model and parameters are affected by epistemic uncertainty. This uncertainty is commonly captured by adding margins at subsystem and system level. In this paper instead, the effect of epistemic uncertainty is modelled with p-boxes on finite sets of values and propagated through the system models to compute the upper and lower expectation on the mass budget. A robust optimisation procedure is then introduced to find the design solution that minimises system mass and the impact of uncertainty.",E & F & G,940
C,Bi-velocity discrete particle swarm optimization and its application to multicast routing problem in communication networks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/bi-velocity-discrete-particle-swarm-optimization-and-its-applicat,"This paper proposes a novel bi-velocity discrete particle swarm optimization (BVDPSO) approach and extends its application to the nondeterministic polynomial (NP) complete multicast routing problem (MRP). The main contribution is the extension of particle swarm optimization (PSO) from the continuous domain to the binary or discrete domain. First, a novel bi-velocity strategy is developed to represent the possibilities of each dimension being 1 and 0. This strategy is suitable to describe the binary characteristic of the MRP, where 1 stands for a node being selected to construct the multicast tree, whereas 0 stands for being otherwise. Second, BVDPSO updates the velocity and position according to the learning mechanism of the original PSO in the continuous domain. This maintains the fast convergence speed and global search ability of the original PSO. Experiments are comprehensively conducted on all of the 58 instances with small, medium, and large scales in the Operation Research Library (OR-library). The results confirm that BVDPSO can obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions rapidly since it only needs to generate a few multicast trees. BVDPSO outperforms not only several state-of-the-art and recent heuristic algorithms for the MRP problems, but also algorithms based on genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and PSO.",H,269

E,Primary physical education: a complex learning journey for children and teachers,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/primary-physical-education-a-complex-learning-journey-for-childre,"Primary physical education (PPE) is increasingly being recognised for the role it can potentially play in setting a foundation for lifelong engagement in physical activity. However, the majority of the literature continues to focus on the negative features of the subject within the primary context. Whilst acknowledging the existence of these barriers, this paper sets out to take a proactive approach by presenting a conceptual framework for PPE that seeks to support a renewed and positive vision for the future. Based on ideas from complexity thinking, the framework represents a move beyond the more positivist and linearapproaches that have long been reported to dominate practices in PPE and recognises learners as active agents engaged in a learning process that is collaborative, non-linear and uncertain.  While acknowledging the contested nature of the complexity field, the paper explores how key principles, including self-organisation, emergence, similarity, diversity, connectedness, nestedness, ambiguous bounding, recursive elaboration and edge of chaos, offer a lens that views PPE as a complex system. With the children’s learning positioned as the focus of PPE in the educational setting, the paper discusses how complexity principles interweave with the ecological components to help us better understand and more creatively engage with the complex nature of PPE developments. Specifically, these components are identified as PPE learning experiences and their associated pedagogy, teachers and their PPE professional learning and key environmental factors that include the physical environment and key stakeholders who influence developments across the different levels of the education system. The paper concludes by suggesting that this complexity-informed PPE framework represents an open invitation for the all those involved in PPE to engage in a collective process of exploration and negotiation to positively influence developments in PPE.",K & L & M,843

D,Accounting for the fictitious: a Marxist contribution to understanding accounting's roles in the financial crisis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/accounting-for-the-fictitious-a-marxist-contribution-to-understan,"This paper presents a contribution to the debates surrounding the culpability of accounting in the recent financial crisis.  It adopts a Marxist theoretical perspective concentrating mainly on Marx’s work on fictitious capital.  Fictitious capital is any form of investment (for example bonds, stocks, derivatives, and collateralized debt obligations) which is based upon the expectation of future returns.  According to Marx while fictitious capital is useful to capitalism, it cannot create value – only human labour can do that.  The recent crisis was exacerbated by the significant amounts of investment which were made in extreme forms of fictitious capital.  The paper argues that the accounting profession’s adoption of financial economic rationalities meant that it helped to animate the form of financialised neo-liberalism which dominated at the time of the crisis. The accounting profession and accounting academia have implemented and propagated technologies and rationalities which enabled, legitimised, and drove the activities of business in general and financial institutions in particular in the run up to and since the crisis.  While, accounting could be seen as being complicit in the crisis, it is important to remember that it was a capitalist crisis.  The intuitional structures of accounting mean that it is susceptible of being captured by the most powerful in society.",B & C,686

C,Fair dealing and the world of work,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/fair-dealing-and-the-world-of-work-2,"Traditionally, labour lawyers have held that there is a strict dichotomy between employment and commercial law; they regulate relationships which are different in nature and underpinned by different values. The emergence of the implied obligation of mutual trust and confidence can be portrayed as confirming the validity of that dichotomy. It is the contention of this paper that it is now increasingly the case that contracts for the provision of work are underpinned by shared values. One of the strongest manifestations of this process of harmonisation is the fact that obligations of fair dealing are becoming much more prevalent. The paper contends that where contracts for the provision of work are concerned this is most likely to occur where the relationship can be seen as analogous to employment. The paper explores the difficulties involved in determining whether an analogous relationship exists and goes on to discuss the implications of harmonisation for both the employment contract and the contract for services. The relevance of the emergence of the concept of the relational contract is addressed.",H & J,260

This article reports a mixed-methods study with parents, pupils and teachers from three Scottish primary schools that examined pupils’ participation in parents’ evenings. Findings revealed that pupils did not attend meetings but were relied upon as a source of preparation by attending parents. Adults rationalized excluding pupils from the perspective of protecting children or indicated a perceived tension between parental and pupil participation. While teachers and parents proposed passive pupil attendance based upon age and meeting content, many pupils were positively disposed towards potential attendance and envisioned more participatory roles during the meetings.

E,Comparison of individual pitch and smart rotor control strategies for load reduction,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/comparison-of-individual-pitch-and-smart-rotor-control-strategies,"Load reduction is increasingly seen as an essential part of controller and wind turbine design. On large multi-MW wind turbines that experience high levels of wind shear and turbulence across the rotor, individual pitch control and smart rotor control are being considered. While individual pitch control involves adjusting the pitch of each blade individually to reduce the cyclic loadings on the rotor, smart rotor control involves activating control devices distributed along the blades to alter the local aerodynamics of the blades. Here we investigate the effectiveness of using a DQ-axis control and a distributed (independent) control for both individual pitch and trailing edge flap smart rotor control. While load reductions are similar amongst the four strategies across a wide range of variables, including blade root bending moments, yaw bearing and shaft, the pitch actuator requirements vary. The smart rotor pitch actuator has reduced travel, rates, accelerations and power requirements than that of the individual pitch controlled wind turbines. This benefit alone however would be hard to justify the added design complexities of using a smart rotor, which can be seen as an alternative to upgrading the pitch actuator and bearing. In addition, it is found that the independent control strategy is apt at roles that the collective pitch usually targets, such as tower motion and speed control, and it is perhaps here, in supplementing other systems, that the future of the smart rotor lies.",F & L & B,113
A,Incorporating life cycle external cost in optimization of the electricity generation mix,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/incorporating-life-cycle-external-cost-in-optimization-of-the-ele,"The present work aims to examine the strategic decision of future electricity generation mix considering, together with all other factors, the effect of the external cost associated with the available power generation technology options, not only during their operation but also during their whole life cycle. The analysis has been performed by integrating the Life Cycle Assessment concept into a linear programming model for the yearly decisions on which option should be used to minimize the electricity generation cost. The model has been applied for the case of Greece for the years 2012-2050 and has led to several interesting results. Firstly, most of the new generating capacity should be renewable (mostly biomass and wind), while natural gas is usually the only conventional fuel technology chosen. If externalities are considered, wind energy increases its share and hydro-power replaces significant amounts of biomass-generated energy. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis has been performed. One of the most important findings is that natural gas increases its contribution when externalities are increased. Summing-up, external cost has been found to be a significant percentage of the total electricity generation cost for some energy sources, therefore significantly changing the ranking order of cost-competitiveness for the energy sources examined.",E,348
B,Size-dependent capacitance study on InGaN-based micro-light-emitting diodes,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/size-dependent-capacitance-study-on-ingan-based-micro-light-emitt,"We report a detailed study on size-dependent capacitance, especially the negative capacitance (NC), in InGaN-based micro-pixelated light-emitting diodes (μLEDs). Similar to conventional broad-area LEDs, μLEDs show NC under large forward bias. In the conventional depletion and diffusion capacitance regimes, a good linear relationship of capacitance with device size is observed. However, the NC under high forward bias shows slight deviation from above-mentioned linear relationship with device size. This behaviour can be understood if the effects of current density and junction temperature on NC are considered. The measured temperature dependence and frequency dispersion of the capacitance underpin this point of view. The NCs of two reference broad-area LEDs were also measured and compared with that of μLED clusters with the same total size. A stronger NC effect is observed in the μLED clusters, which is attributed to the increased number of sidewall defects during fabrication process.",A,215
A,Optimized schwarz methods for Maxwell equations with discontinuous coefficients,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimized-schwarz-methods-for-maxwell-equations-with-discontinuou,"We study non-overlapping Schwarz methods for solving time-harmonic Maxwell’s equations in heterogeneous media. We show that the classical Schwarz algorithm is always divergent when coefficient jumps are present along the interface. In the case of transverse magnetic or transverse electric two dimensional formulations, convergence can be achieved in specific configurations only. We then develop optimized Schwarz methods which can take coefficient jumps into account in their transmission conditions. These methods exhibit rapid convergence, and sometimes converge independently of the mesh parameter, even without overlap. We illustrate our analysis with numerical experiments.",G & H,982
A,Computational approaches to study adsorption in MOFs with unsaturated metal sites,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/computational-approaches-to-study-adsorption-in-mofs-with-unsatur,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) with coordinatively unsaturated sites (CUS) offer interesting possibilities for tuning the affinity of these materials towards certain adsorbates, potentially increasing their selectivity and storage capacity. From a modelling point of view, however, they pose a significant challenge due to the inability of conventional force-fields for dealing with these specific interactions. In this paper, we review recent developments in the application of quantum-mechanical (QM) methods and classical molecular simulations to understand and predict adsorption in MOFs with CUS. We find that hybrid approaches that incorporate QM-based information into classical models are able to provide dramatically improved adsorption predictions relative to conventional force-fields, while yielding a realistic description of the adsorption mechanism in these materials.",I & C & M,301
B,Code or (not code): separating formal and natural language in CS education,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/code-or-not-code-separating-formal-and-natural-language-in-cs-edu,"This paper argues that the ""institutionalised understanding"" of pseudo-code as a blend of formal and natural languages makes it an unsuitable choice for national assessment where the intention is to test program comprehension skills. It permits question-setters to inadvertently introduce a level of ambiguity and consequent confusion. This is not in keeping with either good assessment practice or an argument developed in the paper that CS education should be clearly fostering the skills needed for understanding formal, as distinct from natural, languages. The argument is backed up by an analysis of 49 questions drawn from the national school CS examinations of a single country, spanning a period of six years and two phases -- the first in which no formal pseudo-code was defined, the second in which a formal reference language, referred to as a ""formally-defined pseudo-code"", was provided for teachers and exam setters. The analysis demonstrates that in both phases, incorrect, confusing or ambiguous code was presented in questions. The paper concludes by recommending that the term reference language should be used in place of pseudo-code, and an appropriate formally-defined language specified, in national exam settings where a common language of assessment is required. This change of terms emphasises the characteristics required of a language to be used for assessment of program comprehension. The reference language used in the study is outlined. It was designed by the authors for human readability and also to make absolutely explicit the demarcation between formal and informal language, in such a way that automated checking can be carried out on programs written in the language. Formal specifications and a checker for the language are available.",L,510

A,Islamic Branding and Marketing: Creating a Global Islamic Business [by Paul Temporal],https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/islamic-branding-and-marketing-creating-a-global-islamic-business,"Anybody familiar with Paul Temporal’s other works would also find his latest book Islamic Branding and Marketing: Creating a Global Islamic Business informative. The author’s practitioner background (as a branding consultant), coupled with his academic insight, has equipped him with a binocular to spot the urgency for strategic branding amongst businesses and organisations emerging from or entering Muslim contexts. The main value of the book lies in its discussion of the socio-cultural and economic characteristics of this diverse and large population. Such issues in international/global marketing textbooks are often generally, but unhelpfully briefly, addressed under the subject of ‘adaptation’ or ‘glocalisation’ strategies. Besides, given the fact that relevant books on global/international branding (e.g., Bühler, 2008; Cato, 2010; Gregory & Wiechmann, 2001; Van Gelder, 2003) are generally focused on familiar western brands, Temporal’s book draws marketers’ attention to the myriad brands in non-western contexts. The author’s use of numerous case studies presents to the reader a source of knowledge that is not essentially ‘west-centric’ (see Featherstone, 2006; Jafari, Firat, Suerdem, Askegaard, & Dalli, 2012; Tadajewski, 2010; Tadajewski & Jafari, 2012). This in itself is a valuable contribution to our marketing pedagogical literature which is largely dominated by case studies on repeatedly discussed multinational corporations.",A & B & C & D,596
B,Complex molecules at liquid interfaces: insights from molecular simulation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/complex-molecules-at-liquid-interfaces-insights-from-molecular-si,"The behaviour of complex molecules, such as nanoparticles, polymers, and proteins, at liquid interfaces is of increasing importance in a number of areas of science and technology. It has long been recognised that solid particles adhere to liquid interfaces, which provides a convenient method for the preparation of nanoparticle structures or to modify interfacial properties. The adhesion of proteins at liquid interfaces is important in many biological processes and in a number of materials applications of biomolecules. While the reduced dimensions of these particles make experimental investigation challenging, molecular simulations provide a natural means for the study of these systems. In this paper I will give an overview of some recent work using molecular simulation to investigate the behaviour of complex molecules at liquid interfaces, focusing on the relationship between interfacial adsorption and molecular structure, and outline some avenues for future research.",E & F & G,401
C,Motor competence assessment in young children: convergent validity between the KTK and MOT 4-6 test batteries,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/motor-competence-assessment-in-young-children-convergent-validity,"Objective: The development of motor competence in early childhood substantially contributes to successful engagement in sports and other physical activities. In view of the decreasing levels of physical activity and motor skills in children over the past decades, an appropriate assessment and monitoring of motor competence in early childhood is invaluable, for both research and practice. The purpose of this study was to investigate the convergent validity between two motor competence assessment tools: the Körperkoordinations Test für Kinder (KTK) and the Motoriktest für Vier- bis Sechsjährige Kinder (MOT 4-6). 
Methods and results: Five hundred and thirty 5- and 6- year-old children (277 ♂ and 253 ♀; mean age = 5.95; SD = 0.57) were tested by practiced assessors on the KTK and MOT 4-6 during the same day. From the raw scores, a Motor Quotient was calculated based on normative data of the KTK and MOT 4-6. A Pearson correlation demonstrated a moderately strong positive association between KTK Motor Quotient and MOT 4-6 Motor Quotient (r = 0.605). Crosstabs showed a fair level of agreement between the two tests (K = 0.313; p < 0.001). 
Conclusion: These findings show that some evidence of convergent validity between KTK and MOT 4-6 is provided in present study. However, because of the low level of agreement between KTK and MOT 4-6, practitioners and/or clinicians need to be aware of possible categorisation errors when using the KTK or MOT 4-6 test to detect motor impairments.",H,420
D,On the origins of understanding: from early intentions in utero to shared social projects of common purpose,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/on-the-origins-of-understanding-from-early-intentions-in-utero-to,"This paper examines the origins of the infant mind in its first purposeful movements, evident in utero, and traces their development into complex projects of social meaning-making in the first year of life.  All movements require prospective control, an anticipation of their future effect.  This constitutes the first form of knowledge, knowing ahead of time the effects of a particular self-generated action.  At first, these are basic and simple, but over development they become serially organised into projects requiring greater knowledge of their distal consequences, as they expand in capacity and reach.  This is a transition from brainstem mediated conscious control to more abstract, cortically mediated control.   In social engagement, self-generated acts of expression made with another co-create regular, non-verbal narrative patterns that establish common meaning available for social understanding and sharing intentions.  By tracing development of meaning-making from solo projects in utero to shared narrative projects in early life, we can better appreciate social patterns and their compositions evident in health, disrupted in pathology, and important for development and learning.",I & J,309
E,Associations between objectively measured physical activity and academic attainment in adolescents from a UK cohort,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/associations-between-objectively-measured-physical-activity-and-a,"To test for cross-sectional (at age 11) and longitudinal associations between objectively measured free-living physical activity (PA) and academic attainment in adolescents.   Data from 4755 participants (45% male) with valid measurement of PA (total volume and intensity) by accelerometry at age 11 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) was examined. Data linkage was performed with nationally administered school assessments in English, Maths and Science at ages 11, 13 and 16.  In unadjusted models, total volume of PA predicted decreased academic attainment. After controlling for total volume of PA, percentage of time spent in moderate-vigorous intensity PA (MVPA) predicted increased performance in English assessments in both sexes, taking into account confounding variables. In Maths at 16 years, percentage of time in MVPA predicted increased performance for males (standardised β=0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.22) and females (β=0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.16). For females the percentage of time spent in MVPA at 11 years predicted increased Science scores at 11 and 16 years (β=0.14 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.25) and 0.14 (0.07 to 0.21), respectively). The correction for regression dilution approximately doubled the standardised β coefficients. 
Findings suggest a long-term positive impact of MVPA on academic attainment in adolescence.",K & L & M,938
B,"Quasi-static displacement calibration system for a ""Violin-Mode"" shadow-sensor intended for gravitational wave detector suspensions",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quasi-static-displacement-calibration-system-for-a-violin-mode-sh,"This paper describes the design of, and results from, a calibration system for optical linear displacement- (shadow-) sensors.  The shadow-sensors were designed to detect ‘Violin-Mode’ (VM) resonances in the 0.4 mm diameter silica fibre suspensions of the test-masses / mirrors of advanced LIGO gravitational wave interferometers. Each sensor illuminated the fibre under test, so as to cast its narrow shadow onto a ‘synthesized split photodiode’ detector, the shadow falling over adjacent edges of the paired photodiodes. The apparatus described here translated a vertically orientated silica test fibre horizontally through a collimated Near InfraRed illuminating beam, whilst simultaneously capturing the separate DC ‘shadow notch’ outputs from each of the paired split photodiode detectors.  As the ratio of AC to DC photocurrent sensitivities to displacement was known, a calibration of the DC response to quasi-static shadow displacement allowed the required AC sensitivity to vibrational displacement to be found. Special techniques are described for generating the required constant scan-rate for the test-fibre using a DC motor-driven stage, for removing ‘jitter’ at such low translation rates from a linear magnetic encoder, and so for capturing the two shadow-notch signals at each micrometre of the test-fibre’s travel. Calibration, across the four detectors of this work, gave a vibrational responsivity in voltage terms of (9.45 ± 1.20) MV (rms) / metre (rms), yielding a VM displacement sensitivity of (69 ± 13) picometres (rms) / √Hz, at 500 Hz, over the required measuring span of ±0.1 mm.",M & A,321
D,Modelling of active transformation of microstructure of two-phase Ti alloys during hot working,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/modelling-of-active-transformation-of-microstructure-of-two-phase,"Being very strong and of limited ductility, Ti alloys require special techniques to manufacture the parts with complex shapes. Many of these technologies are based on superplastic and near-to-superplastic deforming. In these processes the transformation of the microstructure of the material can be very significant and can lead to changes in the mechanical properties of the material during deformation. Because of this an appropriate description of the correlation between mechanical loading, changes in microstructure and mechanical behavior of material is required. A phenomenological scalar model with an internal variable based on a statistical description of microstructure is proposed and used for simulation of the high temperature deformation of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The problems of obtaining the parameters of the model and sensitivity of the model to the accuracy of this process are discussed.",B & C,912

The effectiveness of these two different treatments was investigated on strength recovery of glass fibres thermally treated with the conditions imitating composite recycling technology. The regenerated strength levels of these ReCoVeRed fibres must also be further protected and maintained by the use of standard fibre sizing technology similar to standard glass fibre products. Consequently, the effect on fibre strength of the combination of our ReCoVeR treatments with the standard silane coatings was also studied. Significant increase of fibre strength was obtained through the ReCoVeR and coatings treatments, achieving up to 200% increase in fibre strength in comparison with the glass fibre thermally treated.",B & C & D,542

This study has developed and tested a portable wireless gait assessment tool (wi-GAT) to address these challenges. Methods: Ten healthy volunteers participated in the study (age range 23–30 years). Spatio-temporal gait parameters were recorded simultaneously by the Vicon and the wi-GAT systems as each subject walked at their self-selected speed. Results: The stride length and duration, cadence, stance duration and walking speed recorded using the wi-GAT showed strong agreement with those same parameters recorded by the Vicon (ICC of 0.94–0.996). A difference between the systems in registering “toe off” resulted in less agreement (ICC of 0.299–0.847) in gait parameters such as %stance and %swing and DST. Discussion and conclusion: The study demonstrated good concurrent validity for the wi-GAT system. The wi-GAT has the potential to be a useful assessment tool for clinicians.",E & F,416
C,Bias dependence and correlation of the cathodoluminescence and electron beam induced current from an InGaN/GaN light emitting diode,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/bias-dependence-and-correlation-of-the-cathodoluminescence-and-el,"Micron-scale mapping has been employed to study a contacted InGaN/GaN LED using combined electroluminescence (EL), cathodoluminescence (CL), and electron beam induced current (EBIC). Correlations between parameters, such as the EBIC and CL intensity, were studied as a function of applied bias. The CL and EBIC maps reveal small areas, 2–10 μm in size, which have increased nonradiative recombination rate and/or a lower conductivity. The CL emission from these spots is blue shifted, by 30–40 meV. Increasing the reverse bias causes the size of the spots to decrease, due to competition between in-plane diffusion and drift in the growth direction. EL mapping shows large bright areas (∼100 μm) which also have increased EBIC, indicating domains of increased conductivity in the p and/or n-GaN.",H & J,841
C,Estimation of the power electronic converter lifetime in fully rated converter wind turbine for onshore and offshore wind farms,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/estimation-of-the-power-electronic-converter-lifetime-in-fully-ra,"A comparison has been made of the converter lifetime for a 3MW fully rated converter horizontal axis wind turbine located onshore and offshore. Simulated torque and speed of the turbine shaft were used to calculate voltage and current time series, that was used to calculate the junction temperatures of the diode and IGBT in the generator-side converter by a thermal-electrical model. A rainflow counting algorithm was applied to the junction temperature in combination with an empirical model of the lifetime estimation, to calculate the lifetime of the power electronic modules in the turbine. The number of parallel modules for each location to achieve 20 years life time has also been found. Simulations show the lifetime consumption rate of the diode and IGBT is decreased exponentially by increasing number of parallel modules, lowering the average temperature. The offshore wind turbine has a higher lifetime consumption rate, requiring a slightly higher converter rating to achieve a 20-year lifetime, but this difference is small, and both turbines will use the same number of modules.",L & K & C,194
D,Integration of BIM and generative design to exploit AEC conceptual design innovation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/integration-of-bim-and-generative-design-to-exploit-aec-conceptua,"New technological advancements in Architecture-Engineering-Construction (AEC) design has brought the 'level of automation' as a pivotal factor in the success of projects. One of the key debates in 'effective automation' is its congruence throughout the AEC projects. This is currently hampered due to the failures in computational support at the early conceptual design stages. Yet, these failures are significant, and have direct impact upon the success of the AEC design process. Extant literature has identified a significant knowledge gap concerning the key impact links and support mechanisms needed to overtly exploit computational design methods, especially Building Information Modelling (BIM), throughout the conceptual design stage. This study posited that integration of generative design algorithms to the existing BIM platforms could bridge this gap by generating design solutions and transforming them into next stages of detailed design. This paper reports on the conducted survey to investigate perceptions of 153 professionals and students and articulate their approach to different angles of such a technology. Most of the respondents highlighted several deficiencies in the existing tools, whilst they asserted that such a purposeful BIM interface can offer comprehensive support for automation of the entire of AEC design and implementation phases, and particularly enhance the decision making process at the early design phases. Building upon two main constructs of the conducted survey, namely information modelling and form generation, this study further developed conceptual framework for 'virtual generative design workspace' using BIM as the central conduit. The details of this framework are presented in this paper. The developed framework will be used to develop a 'proof of concept' prototype, to actively engage generative design methods into a single dynamic BIM environment. This study contributes by forming a stepping stone for digital integrating of all stages of AEC projects and implementing BIM Level 3 (Cloud), as targeted by many countries",A & D,497

Contrary to most prior research, this study employed an indicator of positive wellbeing and assessed the impact of individual characteristics, perceived social and environmental incivilities, indicators of cognitive and structural social capital, and perceived safety. Analyses of data from a large regional UK representative study (n=8237; 69.64% response rate), obtained using computer assisted software in the respondents’ own homes, found the most influential determinants of wellbeing were physical health problems, age, SES and cognitive social capital. This suggests that the promotion of positive mental health within communities may benefit from efforts to foster a greater sense of belonging among residents. Environmental and social incivilities also appear to play a role in shaping wellbeing, thus interventions to improve local environments can help to play a part.",F & L & B,920

B,A Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model for estimating the health effects of air pollution,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-bayesian-localized-conditional-autoregressive-model-for-estimat,"Estimation of the long-term health effects of air pollution is a challenging task, especially when modeling spatial small-area disease incidence data in an ecological study design. The challenge comes from the unobserved underlying spatial autocorrelation structure in these data, which is accounted for using random effects modeled by a globally smooth conditional autoregressive model. These smooth random effects confound the effects of air pollution, which are also globally smooth. To avoid this collinearity a Bayesian localized conditional autoregressive model is developed for the random effects. This localized model is flexible spatially, in the sense that it is not only able to model areas of spatial smoothness, but also it is able to capture step changes in the random effects surface. This methodological development allows us to improve the estimation performance of the covariate effects, compared to using traditional conditional auto-regressive models. These results are established using a simulation study, and are then illustrated with our motivating study on air pollution and respiratory ill health in Greater Glasgow, Scotland in 2011. The model shows substantial health effects of particulate matter air pollution and nitrogen dioxide, whose effects have been consistently attenuated by the currently available globally smooth models.",A,933
A,Colony loss monitoring surveys in Scotland: winter loss rates and the online versus postal approach,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/colony-loss-monitoring-surveys-in-scotland-winter-loss-rates-and-,"In Scotland we have carried out surveys of beekeepers since 2006, mainly by post. Since 2008 we have used geographically stratified random sampling of the membership records of the Scottish Beekeepers’ Association, excluding those who opted out of surveys, to select the invited participants. In 2013 our survey was conducted online, as far as possible, using the LimeSurvey software (http://www.limesurvey.org/ ) for the first time. This was repeated in 2014.
In 2013, 300 participants were selected from 1094 possible participants, of whom 218 (73%) had email contact details. Postal questionnaires were used for the others, those whose email failed or where there were technical problems: 94 questionnaires were posted and 3 sent electronically for postal return.  Analysis of the 2012-2013 loss data gave 108 beekeeper respondents with valid loss data, of whom 56.5% experienced winter losses. The overall loss rate was 31.6% (158 colonies lost out of 500 colonies wintered). There were differing winter loss rates of 19.3% for the postal respondents and a much higher 36.6% for the online respondents. This difference is highly significant (Fisher's exact test gives a p-value of 0.0001297).  Eleven (50%) of the 22 postal respondents and 50 (58.1%) of the 86 online respondents with valid loss data experienced losses, though this difference was not significant. The profile of the beekeepers differed between the two groups: the postal respondents were typically much more experienced beekeepers than the online respondents. It is therefore important for us to include the postal element for beekeepers not contactable by email, even though the response rate for the online survey was higher (65% online; 36% postal; 55% overall). 
In the 2014 survey, 350 participants were chosen randomly from 1224 possible participants, 273 (78%) had email contact details, and 95 questionnaires were posted, allowing for 17 failing emails and one person with difficulty accessing the survey. 
Preliminary results, based on 118 valid responses collected so far in LimeSurvey from beekeepers, are that 41 (34.7%) experienced losses over winter 2013-14, and that the loss rate was 13.2% (74 colonies lost from 560 wintered colonies).  The final loss rates including postal responses may be expected to be lower.
The 2012-13 winter loss rate of 31.6% was the highest since our surveys began, the next highest being 30.9% over winter 2009-10. It seems likely that the much lower loss rate this last winter can largely be attributed to the different weather conditions.",G & H,329

Party members grant candidates greater leeway to accommodate competing policy demands when in government. The study tests the hypotheses using a new database of party congress speeches from Germany and France, and uses automated text classification to estimate speakers' relative preferences.

The magnitude of the first derivative of absorbance for the aspirin interlayer at 8934 cm-1 was lower when the disk was placed at the top or bottom of the stack of Avicel disks, with the largest signal observed when the aspirin was positioned at the central positions. The variation in signal with depth is consistent with that observed previously for transmission Raman spectrometry. In both cases, the trend observed can be attributed to lower photon density at the air-sample interface, relative to the center of the sample, owing to loss of photons to the air. This results in a reduction in the number of photons absorbed or Raman photons generated and subsequently detected when the interlayer occupies a near-surface position.",D & L,485

Lockers, left and right cotsides, and overbed tables in 30 bed spaces were screened for aerobic colony count (ACC), methicillinsusceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) before cleaning with electrolyzed water. Sites were rescreened at varying intervals from 1 to 48 hours after cleaning. Microbial growth was quantified as colony-forming units (CFUs) per square centimeter and presence or absence of MSSA and MRSA at each site. The study was repeated 3 times at monthly intervals. There was an early and significant reduction in average ACC (360 sampled sites) from a before-cleaning level of 4.3 to 1.65 CFU/cm2 at 1 hour after disinfectant cleaning ( ). P ! .0001 Average counts then increased to 3.53 FU/cm2 at 24 hours and 3.68 CFU/cm2 at 48 hours. Total MSSA/MRSA (34 isolates) decreased by 71% at 4 hours after cleaning but then increased to 155% (53 isolates) of precleaning levels at 24 hours.  Cleaning with electrolyzed water reduced ACC and staphylococci on surfaces beside patients. ACC remained below precleaning levels at 48 hours, but MSSA/MRSA counts exceeded original levels at 24 hours after cleaning. Although disinfectant cleaning quickly reduces bioburden,",A & B & C & D,784
B,The myth of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-myth-of-best-practice-through-the-lens-of-construction-supply,"Much is made of the concept best practice. It is repeatedly drawn upon by policy makers, academics and industry practitioners as a quasi-solution to construction industry ills. As an expression, it is often difficult to contest. Indeed, best practice implies identifying policy, process and procedure that offer the most optimum and efficient outcome. In short, best practice is all about improving performance. However, for the majority of commercial organizations, best strategy is also about improving performance. Despite the apparently congruent ambitions, best practice is not equal to best strategy. This misapprehension only serves to propagate the myth of best practice. This is a polemic paper, exploring the utility of best practice through the lens of construction supply chain management. Drawing inspiration from economic theory, construction management literature and previous supply chain management studies, the myth of best practice in construction supply chain management is exposed. Regardless of Government sponsorship and considerable academic investment, adoption of best practice in UK construction supply chain management remains slow and routinely symbolic. Yet, supply chain members do not behave irrationally. If best practice was truly in their best strategic interests it is highly probable that supply chain members would adjust their rules of economic engagement accordingly. It may be strongly argued that in contrast to the hype and repeated suggestion of supply chain win-win scenarios, UK Government endorsed best practice does not adequately serve the commercial interests of the majority. The very limited achievements of 'Rethinking Construction', serves as a case in point. Disappointingly, few lessons appear to have been learned. The myth of construction supply chain management and by extension best practice in UK construction continues unabated albeit under a shiny new banner, Construction 2025.",E & F & G,681
C,Critical information literacy for the development of political agency,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/critical-information-literacy-for-the-development-of-political-ag,"This paper explores the educational role of libraries in the form of information literacy instruction, and considers the ways in which critical theoretical approaches to information can help citizens to develop political agency – the abilities that empower them to engage in the political world around them. It considers the political position that libraries take when they engage with educational issues. The presentation discusses initial findings from fieldwork conducted in a school in the United Kingdom, which researched young people’s conceptions of political information, how they interact with information sources and how this relates to their sense of political agency. The research sought a
deep understanding of the topic and took a phenomenographic approach. A combination of questionnaires, repertory grid interviews and focus groups, were used to explore how the participants conceive of political information, how they interact with the information to which they are exposed and with one another when discussing political issues and how they position themselves within their
political world. The research is working towards recommendations to contribute to the development of a critical approach to information literacy instruction, which will make recommendations as to how educators supporting young people’s information literacy can engage with the cultural and contextual needs of their learners through the methodological and theoretical approaches taken in this research. The paper concludes that critical information literacy would be of benefit the development of young people’s political agency. Participants’ experiences and conceptions varied, but a commonality between them is an apparent gap between their concerns about their own futures and that of the world around them, and their understanding of their potential to play an active role as informed citizens. Initial findings indicate that there are a number of ways in which information literacy could apply specific critical theories in practice.",H,594
D,Quantification of rhythm problems in disordered speech: a re-evaluation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantification-of-rhythm-problems-in-disordered-speech-a-re-evalu,"Disordered speech can present with rhythmic problems, impacting on an individual’s ability to communicate. Effective treatment relies on the availability of sensitive methods to characterise the problem. Rhythm metrics based on segmental durations originally designed for crosslinguistic research have the potential to provide such information. However, these measures may be associated with problems that impact on their clinical usefulness. This paper aims to address the perceptual validity of crosslinguistic metrics as indicators of rhythmic disorder. Speakers with dysarthria and matched healthy participants performed a range of tasks, including syllable and sentence repetition tasks and a spontaneous monologue. A range of rhythm metrics as well as clinical measures were applied. Results showed that none of the metrics could differentiate disordered from healthy speakers, despite clear perceptual differences, suggesting that factors beyond segment duration impacted on rhythm perception. The investigation also highlighted a number of areas where caution needs to be exercised in the application of rhythm metrics to disordered speech.  The paper concludes that the underlying speech impairment leading to the perceptual and acoustic characterisation of rhythmic problems needs to be established through detailed analysis of speech characteristics in order to construct effective treatment plans for individuals with speech disorders.",I & J,743
E,A highly miniaturized uPPT thruster for attitude-orbit control,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-highly-miniaturized-uppt-thruster-for-attitude-orbit-control,"The successful miniaturization of spacecraft subsystems makes nanosatellites suitable candidates for many scientific missions, and several miniaturized electric propulsion systems on CubeSats have been studied. A Cubesat employing a Pulsed Plasma Thruster module is currently under development by Clyde Space Ltd, Mars Space Ltd and the University of Southampton under contract to ESA and is now entering final qualification testing. Pulsed Plasma Thrusters have been used in satellite attitude control studies of nadir pointing, and satellite rendezvous, docking and formation flying. This paper considers the use of the PPTCUP Pulsed Plasma Thruster in a range of different operational cases that are considered key to the success of many future nanosatellite missions, including moderate low thrust orbit inclination and altitude changes, deorbiting a satellite at the end of life, maintaining ""a string of pearls"" constellation, on-orbit servicing and inspection of a mother satellite, and life extension of an ISS-deployed nanosatellite. PPTCUP uses a very fast electric discharge to ablate a tiny amount of a solid propellant bar, which is then ionized and expelled at high velocity to generate thrust. To generate such a discharge, the thruster charges a high performance capacitor bank for up to a second before discharging it in few microseconds. Based on a current generation system with a mean power input of 2 W, a 40 uN thrust pulse (with a 20 N peak force) can be achieved 1 million times in succession. In order to evaluate the PPTCUP thruster performance, a simulation model has been developed and applied to the identified scenarios, leading to suggestions for baseline control laws suited for the mission. Where necessary, refinement of the design point has been performed to provide a roadmap for future PPTCUP development. We assume a nanosatellite that has a maximum mass of 4 kg at 320-380 km. Drag force and yearly velocity increments are estimated as functions of altitude, drag cross-section and solar activity. Assuming an analysis of a 3U Cubesat frame with PPTCUP, a control approach based on advanced control methods will be used to handle different operational cases. This work finds immediate application for the PPTCUP for challenges such as drag compensation, de-orbiting, and rendezvous and docking manoeuvres, and makes recommendations for future targeting of performance to further improve the capability of PPTCUP equipped satellites. In particular it is noted that advanced control design would improve the coverage of this class of thruster.",K & L & M,859
B,"""Responsible drinkers create all the atmosphere of a mortuary"": policy implementation of responsible drinking in Scotland",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/responsible-drinkers-create-all-the-atmosphere-of-a-mortuary-poli,"The purpose of this paper is to explore the reaction of customer facing staff and their attitude to the introduction of high profile corporate social responsibility (CSR) programmes; in particular their level of awareness and willingness to implement them.
Conducted using a series of site visits and interviews with managers working within the licensed trade, this was followed up with structured interviews of ""front line"" staff.
Despite high levels of awareness of both the social problems relating to alcohol consumption and the legislative changes, engagement with operational CSR was limited and often disinterested. Legal and societal expectations regarding drunkenness are of little concern.
This paper is concerned with nascent legislation, the full impact and success of which has not yet emerged. Reviewing this study in five years would add to the strength of the results. Limited to Scotland due to its devolved licensing laws, however, it clearly highlights lack of employee engagement with CSR.
Despite placing CSR issues at the forefront of day to day operations within the licensed trade there is little empirical evidence around customer facing staff engagement. CSR is a dynamic process that relies on the involvement of employees for its successful implementation.
A new CSR implementation matrix is presented which allows hospitality businesses to be positioned according to levels of both management and employee engagement with CSR policies.",M & A,556
D,A study of vortex ring generation by a circular disc,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-study-of-vortex-ring-generation-by-a-circular-disc,"A vortex ring is a region where the fluid mostly spins around an imaginary axis line that forms a closed loop. It is a fundamental phenomenon for the fluid passing by an object. In general, there are two methods associated with the axisymmetric vortex generation: fluid discharge from an orifice or a nozzle, and disc start-up instantly. Recent study by Yang (2012)  showed that the different mechanisms of vortex generation could lead  to a similar formation process and a universal principle of the optimal vortex formation could exist. 
Present work is mainly based on a numerical simulation study of disc vortex ring formation. A commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics solver is employed to carry out the simulation. The simulation parameters are selected the same as those of Yang’s (2012) experimental study. The model is built with fluid passing by a 30mm diameter and 2mm thickness disc in a large  computational domain. The simulation results are validated with experimental data. By studying the Iso-surface, representative values, i.e. size of both vortex ring and vortex ring core, circulation and kinetic energy during the formation phases of the vortex ring are investigated. Comparison and analyses between the numerical simulation and the experimental data will be given in detail.",B & C,209
A,Connecting with the past: meeting the needs of ancestral tourists in Scotland,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/connecting-with-the-past-meeting-the-needs-of-ancestral-tourists-,"An ancestral legacy is often viewed as the epitome of heritage tourism (McCain, 2003) and can generate the feelings of personal attachment craved by many tourists (Timothy and Boyd, 2006). Ancestral tourism supports individuals who, despite an existing identity in one country, feel a connection to another ‘homeland’ (Palmer, 1999). McCain and Ray (2003) suggest that tourism associated with personal legacy offers an experience with functional, social, emotional and epistemic value dimensions (Williams & Soutar, 2009). However, there is scant research which considers the added value that ancestral tourism can provide to a destination despite the range of benefits that may be accrued by communities which meet the needs of ancestral tourists (Timothy, 1997).
Scotland, a nation which maintains and projects powerful brand signifiers of its cultural heritage (McCrone, Morris and Kiely, 1995) is also a country which witnessed considerable emigration between the 18th and 20th century. Although much emigration was voluntary and motivated by a search for economic opportunity, it is the enforced clearing of Scots as part of an economic restructuring that generates particularly evocative images. By 1914 more than 2 million Scots had emigrated, mainly to the British Dominions of Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  An estimated 800,000 visitors a year are estimated to come to Scotland with ancestral motivations but a global Scottish diaspora (which could number between 40 and 80 million) is estimated to be worth several billion pounds to the Scottish economy over the next decade. We sought to explore how the needs of ancestral tourists are met through a qualitative study involving 28 in-depth interviews with curators and tourism professionals and non-participant observation at a range of heritage and genealogical attractions across the whole of Scotland.   Our research reveals a spectrum of ancestral tourists from roots tourists who appear to be satisfied with putting their ‘feet on the ground’ where their ancestors lived; to genealogy tourists who often visit with an obsession for ‘generation bagging’  and gaining detailed documentary insight into their ancestral past.  We contribute to heritage tourism studies by revealing how extensive and well preserved archives, local knowledge and a passion for family history can serve to generate unique and deeply emotional tourism experiences for ancestral tourists. Despite the often ‘cottage industry’ nature of many ancestral attractions (often reliant on volunteers and local ‘good will) the outcome of the visit can often be greater satisfaction and a strong repeat visitation pattern.",B & C & D,449
E,A targeted oligonucleotide enhancer of SMN2 Exon 7 splicing forms competing quadruplex and protein complexes in functional conditions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-targeted-oligonucleotide-enhancer-of-smn2-exon-7-splicing-forms,"The use of oligonucleotides to activate the splicing of selected exons is limited by a poor understanding of the mechanisms affected. A targeted bifunctional oligonucleotide enhancer of splicing (TOES) anneals to SMN2 exon 7 and carries an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) sequence. We show that it stimulates splicing specifically of intron 6 in the presence of repressing sequences in intron 7. Complementarity to the 5' end of exon 7 increases U2AF65 binding, but the ESE sequence is required for efficient recruitment of U2 snRNP. The ESE forms at least three coexisting discrete states: a quadruplex, a complex containing only hnRNP F/H, and a complex enriched in the activator SRSF1. Neither hnRNP H nor quadruplex formation contributes to ESE activity. The results suggest that splicing limited by weak signals can be rescued by rapid exchange of TOES oligonucleotides in various complexes and raise the possibility that SR proteins associate transiently with ESEs.",E & F,980
C,Gradient-based subspace phase correlation for fast and effective image alignment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/gradient-based-subspace-phase-correlation-for-fast-and-effective-,"Phase correlation is a well-established frequency domain method to estimate rigid 2-D translational motion between pairs of images. However, it suffers from interference terms such as noise and non-overlapped regions. In this paper, a novel variant of the phase correlation approach is proposed, in which 2-D translation is estimated by projection-based subspace phase correlation (SPC). Conventional wisdom has suggested that such an approach can only amount to a compromise solution between accuracy and efficiency. In this work, however, we prove that the original SPC and the further introduced gradient-based SPC can provide robust solution to zero-mean and non-zero-mean noise, and the latter is also used to model the interference term of non-overlapped regions. Comprehensive results from synthetic data and MRI images have fully validated our methodology. Due to its substantially lower computational complexity, the proposed method offers additional advantages in terms of efficiency and can lend itself to very fast implementations for a wide range of applications where speed is at a premium.",H & J,949
C,What's around the corner? Enhancing driver awareness in autonomous vehicles via in-vehicle spatial auditory displays,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/whats-around-the-corner-enhancing-driver-awareness-in-autonomous-,"There is currently a distinct lack of design consideration associated with autonomous vehicles and their impact on human factors. Research has yet to consider fully the impact felt by the driver when he/she is no longer in control of the vehicle [12]. We propose that spatialised auditory feedback could be used to enhance driver awareness to the intended actions of autonomous vehicles. We hypothesise that this feedback will provide drivers with an enhanced sense of control. This paper presents a driving simulator study where 5 separate auditory feedback methods are compared during both autonomous and manual driving scenarios. We found that our spatialised auditory presentation method alerted drivers to the intended actions of autonomous vehicles much more than all other methods and they felt significantly more in control during scenarios containing sound vs. no sound. Finally, that overall workload in autonomous vehicle scenarios was lower compared to manual vehicle scenarios.",L & K & C,829
D,An evaluation of enteral nutrition practices and nutritional provision in children during the entire length of stay in critical care,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-evaluation-of-enteral-nutrition-practices-and-nutritional-prov,"Provision of optimal nutrition in children in critical care is often challenging. This study evaluated exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) provision practices and explored predictors of energy intake and delay of EN advancement in critically ill children. Data on intake and EN practices were collected on a daily basis and compared against predefined targets and dietary reference values in a paediatric intensive care unit. Factors associated with intake and advancement of EN were explored. Data were collected from 130 patients and 887 nutritional support days (NSDs). Delay to initiate EN was longer in patients from both the General Surgical and congenital heart defect (CHD) Surgical groups [Median (IQR); CHD Surgical group: 20.3 (16.4) vs General Surgical group: 11.4 (53.5) vs Medical group: 6.5 (10.9) hours; p ≤ 0.001]. Daily fasting time per patient was significantly longer in patients from the General Surgical and CHD Surgical groups than those from the Medical group [% of 24 h, Median (IQR); CHD Surgical group: 24.0 (29.2) vs General Surgical group: 41.7 (66.7) vs Medical group: 9.4 (21.9); p ≤ 0.001]. A lower proportion of fluids was delivered as EN per patient (45% vs 73%) or per NSD (56% vs 73%) in those from the CHD Surgical group compared with those with medical conditions. Protein and energy requirements were achieved in 38% and 33% of the NSDs. In a substantial proportion of NSDs, minimum micronutrient recommendations were not met particularly in those patients from the CHD Surgical group. A higher delivery of fluid requirements (p < 0.05) and a greater proportion of these delivered as EN (p < 0.001) were associated with median energy intake during stay and delay of EN advancement. Fasting (31%), fluid restriction (39%) for clinical reasons, procedures requiring feed cessation and establishing EN (22%) were the most common reasons why target energy requirements were not met. Provision of optimal EN support remains challenging and varies during hospitalisation and among patients. Delivery of EN should be prioritized over other ""non-nutritional"" fluids whenever this is possible.",A & D,607

Following these influences, this study explores the potentialized context of punk entrepreneurship. The Punk Rock band Rancid has a 20-year history of successfully creating independent musical and related creative enterprises from the margins of the music industry. The study draws on artefacts, interviews and videos created by and around Rancid to identify and analyse this example of marginal, alternative entrepreneurship. A three-part analytic frame was applied to analysing these artefacts. Place is critical to Rancid’s enterprise, grounding the band socially, culturally, geographically and politically. Practice also plays an important role with Rancid’s activities encompassing labour, making music, movement and human interactions. The third, and most prevalent, dimension of alterity is that of power which includes data related to dominance, subordination, exclusion, control and liberation. Rancid’s entrepreneurial story is depicted as cycles, not just a linear journey, but following more complicated paths – from periphery to centre, and back again; returning to roots, whilst trying to move forwards too; grounded in tradition but also radically focused on dramatic change. Paradox, hybridized practices, and the significance of marginal place as a rich resource also emerged from the study.",F & L & B,369

The Crotalus adamanteus toxin-II (CaTx-II) induced bactericidal effects (7.8 μg/ml) on Staphylococcus aureus, while on Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), and Enterobacter aerogenes were killed at 15.6 μg/ml. CaTx-II caused pore formation and membrane damaging effects on the bacterial cell wall. CaTx-II was not cytotoxic on lung (MRC-5), skin fibroblast (HEPK) cells and in mice. CaTx-II-treated mice showed significant wound closure and complete healing by 16 days as compared to untreated controls (**P<0.01). Histological examination revealed enhanced collagen synthesis and neovascularization after treatment with CaTx-II versus 2% Fusidic Acid ointment (FAO) treated controls. Measurement of tissue cytokines revealed that interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) expression in CaTx-II treated mice was significantly suppressed versus untreated controls. In contrast, cytokines involved in wound healing and cell migration i.e., monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), fibroblast growth factor-basic (FGF-b), chemokine (KC), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly enhanced in CaTx-II treated mice, but not in the controls. CaTx-II also modulated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) activation during skin wound healing.

B,Motor control strategies and the effects of fatigue on golf putting performance,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/motor-control-strategies-and-the-effects-of-fatigue-on-golf-putti,"This study investigated the strategies used by elite golfers to scale their putting actions to achieve putts of different distances. There were three aims; to determine if putting actions are scaled by manipulating swing amplitude as predicted by Craig et al. (2000), to establish the test-retest reliability of the Craig et al. model, and to evaluate whether elite golfers changed their putting scaling strategies when fatigued. Putting actions were recorded at baseline (time 1) and 6 months later (time 2) and after walking at 70% of maximum heart rate for 1 h (time 3). Participants performed a total of 80 putts which varied in distance (1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m) at time 1 and time 2, and 100 putts to the same distances when they were fatigued (time 3). Multiple regression was used to examine how the golfers systematically changed the movement control variables in the Craig et al. (2000) model to achieve golf putts of different distances. Although swing amplitude was a strong predictor of putterhead velocity at ball impact for all of the participants at baseline (time 1), each golfer systematically changed aspects of the timing of their action. A comparison of the regression models between time 1 and time 2 showed no significant changes in the scaling strategies used, indicating that the Craig et al. (2000) model had good test-retest reliability. Fatigue was associated with a decrease in the number of putts that were successfully holed and significant changes in the scaling strategies used by three of the golfers, along with a trend for increasing the putterhead velocity at ball impact. These motor control changes in performance when fatigued were evident in successful putts indicating that even when these elite golfers were able to achieve the goal of holing the putt, moderate levels of fatigue were influencing the consistency of their performance. Theoretical implications for the Craig et al. (2000) model and practical implications for elite golfers are discussed.",E & F & G,104

Does the paradox ‘‘hold’’ for other individual characteristics like income or happiness? To address this question, we generalize the friendship paradox for arbitrary node characteristics in complex networks. By analyzing two coauthorship networks of Physical Review journals and Google Scholar profiles, we find that the generalized friendship paradox (GFP) holds at the individual and network levels for various characteristics, including the number of coauthors, the number of citations, and the number of publications. The origin of the GFP is shown to be rooted in positive correlations between degree and characteristics. As a fruitful application of the GFP, we suggest effective and efficient sampling methods for identifying high characteristic nodes in large-scale networks. Our study on the GFP can shed lights on understanding the interplay between network structure and node characteristics in complex networks.",H,873
D,Hiding behind the camera: social learning within the cooperative learning model to engage girls in physical education,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/hiding-behind-the-camera-social-learning-within-the-cooperative-l,"Research suggests that girls are disengaged in physical education due to the ‘traditional’ way that it is taught, i.e. teacher-centred approaches with a primary focus on motor performance. In contrast, Cooperative Learning, a student-centred pedagogy focusing on learning in multiple domains, has had success in engaging girls in physical education. Furthermore, when cooperative group work has been combined with technology, student engagement with learning is heightened. This article discusses the use of Cooperative Learning and video cameras to bring about a positive change to the learning environment for girls who were identified as being disengaged in physical education. Two classes of adolescent girls were taught an eight-lesson unit of Basketball using Cooperative Learning. Students worked in learning teams, participating in different roles, such as a coach or a camerawoman, to help each other learn and to film video clips of their learning. Data collection included a teacher's reflective journal, post-lesson teacher analysis tool, student interviews and the analysis of learning teams' movies. Inductive analysis and constant comparison was used for data analyses. Findings suggest that the role of the coach and the camerawoman was pivotal to girls' engagement. Some girls only ‘fully’ participated in lessons when learning was within the social and cognitive domains, since they could ‘hide behind the camera’ and were not required to participate physically. We controversially suggest that, in order to engage girls in physical education, we may have to temporarily remove the physical domain of learning (at least for some girls) in order to positively affect their longer term engagement in the subject.",I & J,229

The exploitation of these resources has been discussed as a means to lower the cost of future space endeavours. Recent, a new family of so-called Easily Retrievable Objects that can be transported from accessible heliocentric orbits into the Earth’s neighbourhood at affordable costs, have been presented. In this paper, the trajectory options for low-cost missions to EROs are explored. We consider a wide variety of multi-impulse transfer, gravity-assist transfer and gravity-assist transfer with mid-maneuvers to obtain low launch energy and rendezvous trajectories to EROs. There trajectories are constructed by analytic and numerical search methods, and hybrid optimization algorithms including global search and local search to find the optimal rendezvous opportunities. The best rendezvous opportunities for currently known EROs in the next 20 years are reported. The relevant mission costs are analyzed. A discussion of general characteristics of the various trajectory types is followed.",K & L & M,682
B,Prognostic modelling of valve degradation within power stations,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/prognostic-modelling-of-valve-degradation-within-power-stations,"Within the field of power generation, aging assets and a desire for improved maintenance decision-making tools have led to growing interest in asset prognostics. Valve failures can account for 7% or more of mechanical failures, and since a conventional power station will contain many hundreds of valves, this represents a significant asset base. This paper presents a prognostic approach for estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of valves experiencing degradation, utilizing a similarity-based method. Case study data is generated through simulation of valves within a 400MW Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power station.

High fidelity industrial simulators are often produced for operator training, to allow personnel to experience fault procedures and take corrective action in safe, simulation environment, without endangering staff or equipment. This work repurposes such a high fidelity simulator to generate the type of condition monitoring data which would be produced in the presence of a fault. A first principles model of valve degradation was used to generate multiple run-to- failure events, at different degradation rates. The associated parameter data was collected to generate a library of failure cases. This set of cases was partitioned into training and test sets for prognostic modelling and the similarity based prognostic technique applied to calculate RUL. Results are presented of the technique’s accuracy, and conclusions are drawn about the applicability of the technique to this domain.",M & A,177
D,A single-stage three-phase DC/AC inverter based on Cuk converter for PV application,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-single-stage-three-phase-dcac-inverter-based-on-cuk-converter-f,"This paper presents a new three-phase dc-ac inverter based on the basic Cuk converter. The main feature of the proposed topology is the fact that the energy storage elements as inductors and capacitors values can be reduced in order to improve the reliability, reduce the size, and the total cost. Moreover, the bucking-boosting inherent nature of the Cuk converter, depending on the time-varying duty ratios, provides more flexibility for stand-alone and grid connected applications when the required output AC voltage is lower or greater than the DC side voltage. This property is not found in the conventional current source inverter (CSI) when the DC input current is always greater than the ac output one or in the conventional voltage source inverter (VSI) as the output ac voltage is always lower than the dc input one. Averaged large and small signal models are used to study the Cuk nonlinear operation. Basic structure, control design, and MATLAB/SIMULINK results are presented in this paper. The new three-phase DC-AC inverter is very convenient for PV applications where continuous average input currents are required for appropriate Maximum power Point Tracking (MPPT) operations.",B & C,765
A,Standing-wave-excited multiplanar fluorescence in a laser scanning microscope reveals 3D information on red blood cells,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/standing-wave-excited-multiplanar-fluorescence-in-a-laser-scannin,"Standing-wave excitation of fluorescence is highly desirable in optical microscopy because it improves the axial resolution. We demonstrate here that multiplanar excitation of fluorescence by a standing wave can be produced in a single-spot laser scanning microscope by placing a plane reflector close to the specimen. We report here a variation in the intensity of fluorescence of successive planes related to the Stokes shift of the dye. We show by the use of dyes specific for the cell membrane how standing-wave excitation can be exploited to generate precise contour maps of the surface membrane of red blood cells, with an axial resolution of 90 nm. The method, which requires only the addition of a plane mirror to an existing confocal laser scanning microscope, may well prove useful in studying diseases which involve the red cell membrane, such as malaria.",B & C & D,366
E,Coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering: influence of the intermolecular potential,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/coherent-rayleigh-brillouin-scattering-influence-of-the-intermole,The spectrum of the coherent Rayleigh-Brillouin scattering (CRBS) of light by a rarefied gas is obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation numerically using the fast spectral method. The influence of the intermolecular potential on the CRBS spectrum is investigated and the accuracy of the prevailing Tenti’s s6 kinetic model is evaluated. Our numerical results show that i) the intermolecular potential has a great influence on CRBS spectrum when the Knudsen number is between 0.05 and 1 and ii) Tenti’s s6 kinetic model can only predict the line shape accurately for Maxwell gases at small Knudsen numbers.,E & F,518
C,'No-one runs away for no reason': understanding safeguarding issues when children and young people go missing from home,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/no-one-runs-away-for-no-reason-understanding-safeguarding-issues-,"An estimated one in nine children will run away from home or substitute care before their 16th birthday in the UK. This paper explores the safeguarding concerns and responses for children and young people who run away or go missing from home. The majority of children and young people run away from home due to family relationship problems. Running away or being physically absent from home may be due to abuse and neglect. One in 11 children reported being hurt or harmed whilst running away. For some young people, 'running to' a person or situation can present many risks and can be part of a coercive and exploitative relationship. Despite these multiple indicators of risk, there has been little focus on safeguarding policies and practice for children and young people who run away from home. Drawing on a case example of a third-sector service using Return Interview Assessments, this paper argues that professionals must ensure that all children and young people who run away or go missing from home are given meaningful opportunities to be listened to, and taken seriously, in order to ensure that a wide range of safeguarding concerns can be addressed.",H & J,791
C,Inner retinal preservation in rat models of retinal degeneration implanted with subretinal photovoltaic arrays,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/inner-retinal-preservation-in-rat-models-of-retinal-degeneration-,"Photovoltaic arrays (PVA) implanted into the subretinal space of patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) are designed to electrically stimulate the remaining inner retinal circuitry in response to incident light, thereby recreating a visual signal when photoreceptor function declines or is lost. Preservation of inner retinal circuitry is critical to the fidelity of this transmitted signal to ganglion cells and beyond to higher visual targets. Post-implantation loss of retinal interneurons or excessive glial scarring could diminish and/or eliminate PVA-evoked signal transmission. As such, assessing the morphology of the inner retina in RP animal models with subretinal PVAs is an important step in defining biocompatibility and predicting success of signal transmission. In this study, we used immunohistochemical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively compare inner retinal morphology after the implantation of a PVA in two RP models: the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) or transgenic S334ter-line 3 (S334ter-3) rhodopsin mutant rat. Two PVA designs were compared. In the RCS rat, we implanted devices in the subretinal space at 4 weeks of age and histologically examined them at 8 weeks of age and found inner retinal morphology preservation with both PVA devices. In the S334ter-3 rat, we implanted devices at 6-12 weeks of age and again, inner retinal morphology was generally preserved with either PVA design 16-26 weeks post-implantation. Specifically, the length of rod bipolar cells and numbers of cholinergic amacrine cells were maintained along with their characteristic inner plexiform lamination patterns. Throughout the implanted retinas we found nonspecific glial reaction, but none showed additional glial scarring at the implant site. Our results indicate that subretinally implanted PVAs are well-tolerated in rodent RP models and that the inner retinal circuitry is preserved, consistent with our published results showing implant-evoked signal transmission.",L & K & C,534
D,Incorporation of uranium into hematite during crystallization from ferrihydrite,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/incorporation-of-uranium-into-hematite-during-crystallization-fro,"Ferrihydrite was exposed to U(VI)-containing cement leachate (pH 10.5) and aged to induce crystallization of hematite. A combination of chemical extractions, TEM, and XAS techniques provided the first evidence that adsorbed U(VI) (≈3000 ppm) was incorporated into hematite during ferrihydrite aggregation and the early stages of crystallization, with continued uptake occurring during hematite ripening. Analysis of EXAFS and XANES data indicated that the U(VI) was incorporated into a distorted, octahedrally coordinated site replacing Fe(III). Fitting of the EXAFS showed the uranyl bonds lengthened from 1.81 to 1.87 Å, in contrast to previous studies that have suggested that the uranyl bond is lost altogether upon incorporation into hematite the results of this study both provide a new mechanistic understanding of uranium incorporation into hematite and define the nature of the bonding environment of uranium within the mineral structure. Immobilization of U(VI) by incorporation into hematite has clear and important implications for limiting uranium migration in natural and engineered environments. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",A & D,196
E,Water resource management and climate change adaptation: a holistic and multiple criteria perspective,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/water-resource-management-and-climate-change-adaptation-a-holisti,"Anthropogenic climate change is likely to significantly increase human exposure to droughts and floods. It will also alter seasonal patterns of water availability and affect water quality and the health of aquatic ecosystems with various implications for social and economic wellbeing. Policy development for water resource adaptation needs to allow for a holistic and transparent analysis of the probable consequences of policy options for the wide variety of water uses and users, and the existing ecosystem services associated with any stream basin. This paper puts forward an innovative methodological framework for planning development-compatible climate policies drawing on multi-criteria decision analysis and an implicit risk-management approach to the economics of climate change. Its objectives are to describe how the generic methodology could be tailored for analysis of long-range water planning and policy options in developing countries, and to describe the place of climate change considerations in water governance and planning processes. An experimental thought-exercise applying the methodology to water policy development in Yemen provides further insights on the complexity of water adaptation planning. It also highlights the value of conducting sensitivity analysis to explore the implications of multiple climate scenarios, and the importance of accounting for policy portfolios rather than individual policy options. Rather than constituting a tool that can generate clear measures of optimal solutions in the context of adaptation to uncertain climate futures, we find that this approach is best suited to supporting comprehensive and inclusive planning processes, where the focus is on finding socially acceptable paths forward.",F & L & B,170

In-depth discussion and analysis of the converter's operating principle, basic relationships that govern converter steady-state operation and details of the necessary control structures needed to comply with the grid code are provided. The validity of the proposed system is confirmed using power system computer aided design (PSCAD)/electromagnetic transients including DC (EMTDC) simulations, and is substantiated experimentally. The buck–boost converter under investigation has good dynamic performance in both buck and boost modes, and ensures near unity input power factor over the full operating range, whilst having fewer devices and passive elements than other published versions of the buck–boost converter.",E,890
B,Covenanting exchanges with the French court during the wars for the three kingdoms,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/covenanting-exchanges-with-the-french-court-during-the-wars-for-t,"In 1638, Scots opposed to the imposition of administrative, social, economic and religious uniformity by Charles I exercised their right of resistance by issuing a patriotic manifesto, the National Covenant, which sought to impose permanent checks on monarchy. This resistance was carried further by the Scottish Covenanters fighting and winning the Bishops’ Wars in 1639-40 and then exporting their revolution through armed intervention in Ireland from 1642 and in England from 1644. The Scottish Covenanters’ alliance with the English Parliamentarians was formalised by the Solemn League and Covenant which again sought to impose permanent checks on monarchy throughout the three Stuart kingdoms. But these events cannot be viewed solely as British and Irish Civil Wars. They must be contextualised in relation to the Thirty Years War and particularly to the determination of France under both Cardinals Richelieu and Mazarin to supplant the Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs as the foremost European power. While much work has recently been done on the diplomatic links of the principal protagonists in the Civil Wars, the importance of France to Scottish Covenanters, English Parliamentarians and Irish Confederates in their tangled and tortuous relationships among themselves and with Charles I remains relatively underworked. This article does not attempt a comprehensive review, but sketches out the intricacies of Covenanting exchanges with the French Court before all prospects of a revived ‘auld alliance’ were crushed by the occupation of Scotland by Oliver Cromwell and his English regicides in 1651.",A,976

Time-variation in the models׳ parameters allows for the weights attached to each financial variable in the index to evolve over time. Furthermore, we develop methods for dynamic model averaging or selection which allow the financial variables entering into the financial conditions index to change over time.

B,Atmospheric reentry modelling using an open source DSMC code,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/atmospheric-reentry-modelling-using-an-open-source-dsmc-code,"Aerothermodynamic investigations of hypersonic re-entry vehicles provides crucial information to other key disciplines as structures and materials, assisting the development of efficient and lightweight thermal protection systems (TPS). Under the transitional flow regime, where chemical and thermal nonequilibrium are predominant, the most successful numerical method for such studies has been the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) numerical technique. In the present work, the solver dsmcFoam has been benchmarked against experimental, numerical, and theoretical data found in the open literature for inert and chemically reactive flows. The Quantum-Kinetic (QK) chemistry model with a full set of 19 chemical reactions has been implemented into the code and it proved to be essential in the correct prediction of the shock wave structure and heating flux to the vehicle’s surface during the re-entry phase. Having implemented the QK chemistry model, the dsmcF oam solver was employed to investigate thermal protection system discontinuities. These TPS discontinuities, representative of panel-to-panel joints or the impact of micro meteorites/ice droplets, were modelled as a family of cavities with different length-to-depth ratios. The results showed that the cavity length has a significant impact on the flowfield structure and aerodynamic surface quantities distribution inside and around the cavities. In addition, for L/D = 5, the flow separates at the cavity upstream lip and attaches to the cavity bottom surface, representing a potentially catastrophic feature under rarefied gas conditions. Furthermore, the same phenomena is only observed in the continuum regime when L/D > 14.",L,377

This power interface control is proposed to achieve high accuracy in PHIL simulation with closed-loop control for aerospace, marine or micro grid applications. Rather than analyzing the Real Time Simulator (RTS) data and controlling the interface using time-domain resonant controllers, the RTS data will be analyzed and controlled at the interface in the frequency domain, on a harmonic-by-harmonic and phase-by-phase basis. This should allow the RTS time delay to be compensated accurately, and removes the requirement to include additional components to compensate for the simulation delay into the simulated power system as it is not appropriate for power systems which have short transmission lines. This is extremely relevant for marine and micro grid scenarios where such inductive components may not be present.",B & H,114
C,A hybrid compressible-incompressible computational fluid dynamics method for richtmyer-meshkov mixing,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-hybrid-compressible-incompressible-computational-fluid-dynamics,"This paper presents a hybrid compressible–incompressible approach for simulating the Richtmyer–Meshkov instability (RMI) and associated mixing. The proposed numerical approach aims to circumvent the numerical deficiencies of compressible methods at low Mach (LM) numbers, when the flow has become essentially incompressible. A compressible flow solver is used at the initial stage of the interaction of the shock wave with the fluids interface and the development of the RMI. When the flow becomes sufficiently incompressible, based on a Mach number prescribed threshold, the simulation is carried out using an incompressible flow solver. Both the compressible and incompressible solvers use Godunov-type methods and high-resolution numerical reconstruction schemes for computing the fluxes at the cell interfaces. The accuracy of the model is assessed by using results for a two-dimensional (2D) single-mode RMI.",D & L,1000
A,Stochastic dynamical behavior of SIRS epidemic models with random perturbation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/stochastic-dynamical-behavior-of-sirs-epidemic-models-with-random,"In this paper, we consider a stochastic SIRS model with parameter perturbation, which is a standard technique in modeling population dynamics. In our model, the disease transmission coefficient and the removal rates are all affected by noise. We show that the stochastic model has a unique positive solution as it is essential in any population model. Then we establish conditions for extinction
or persistence of the infectious disease. When the infective part is forced to expire, the susceptible part converges weakly to an inverse-gamma distribution with explicit shape and scale parameters. In case of persistence, by new stochastic Lyapunov functions, we show the ergodic property and positive
recurrence of the stochastic model. We also derive an estimate for the mean of the stationary distribution.  The analytical results are all verified by computer simulations, including examples based on experiments in laboratory populations of mice.",A & B & C & D,695
B,Experimental entanglement activation from discord in a programmable quantum measurement,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/experimental-entanglement-activation-from-discord-in-a-programmab,"In quantum mechanics, observing is not a passive act. Consider a system of two quantum particles A and B: if a measurement apparatus M is used to make an observation on B, the overall state of the system AB will typically be altered. When this happens, no matter which local measurement is performed, the two objects A and B are revealed to possess peculiar correlations known as quantum discord. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that the very act of local observation gives rise to an activation protocol which converts discord into distillable entanglement, a stronger and more useful form of quantum correlations, between the apparatus M and the composite system AB. We adopt a flexible two-photon setup to realize a three-qubit system (A, B, M) with programmable degrees of initial correlations, measurement interaction, and characterization processes. Our experiment demonstrates the fundamental mechanism underpinning the ubiquitous act of observing the quantum world and establishes the potential of discord in entanglement generation.",E & F & G,869
C,Prognostic modeling for electrical treeing in solid insulation using pulse sequence analysis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/prognostic-modeling-for-electrical-treeing-in-solid-insulation-us,"This paper presents a prognostic framework for estimating the time-to-failure (TTF) of insulation samples under electrical treeing stress. The degradation data is taken from electrical treeing experiments on 25 epoxy resin samples. Breakdown occurs in all tests within 2.5 hours. Partial discharge (PD) data from 18 samples are used as training data for prognostic modeling and 7 for model validation. The degradation parameter used in this model is the voltage difference between consecutive PD pulses, which decreases prior to breakdown. Every training sample shows a decreasing exponential trend when plotting the root mean squared (RMS) of the voltage difference for 5 minute batches of data. An average model from the training data is developed to determine the RMS voltage difference during breakdown. This breakdown indicator is verified over three time horizons of 25, 50 and 75 minutes. Results show the best estimation of TTF for 50 minutes of data, with error within quantified bounds. This suggests the framework is a promising approach to estimating insulation TTF.",H,718
D,A prospective evaluation of the predictive value of faecal calprotectin in quiescent Crohn's disease,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-prospective-evaluation-of-the-predictive-value-of-faecal-calpro,"Background: The faecal calprotectin (FC) test is a non-invasive marker for gastrointestinal inflammation. Aim: To determine whether higher FC levels in individuals with quiescent Crohn's disease are associated with clinical relapse over the ensuing 12 months. Methods: A single centre prospective study was undertaken in Crohn's disease patients in clinical remission attending for routine review. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the primary endpoint of clinical relapse by 12 months, based on FC at baseline, was calculated. Kaplan-Meier curves of time to relapse were based on the resulting optimal FC cutoff for predicting relapse. Results: Of 97 patients recruited, 92 were either followed up for 12 months without relapsing, or reached the primary endpoint within that period. Of these, 10 (11 had relapsed by 12 months. The median FC was lower for non-relapsers, 96?g/g (IQR 39-237), than for relapsers, 414?g/g (IQR 259-590), (p=0.005). The area under the ROC curve to predict relapse using FC was 77.4 An optimal cutoff FC value of 240?g/g to predict relapse of quiescent Crohn's had sensitivity of 80.0% and specificity of 74.4 Negative predictive value was 96.8% and positive predictive value was 27.6 FC?240mug/g was associated with likelihood of relapse 5.7 (95% CI 1.9-17.3) times higher within 2.3 years than lower values (p=0.002). Conclusions: In this prospective dataset, FC appears to be a useful, non-invasive tool to help identify quiescent Crohn's disease patients at a low risk of relapse over the ensuing 12 months. FC of 240?g/g was the optimal cutoff in this cohort.",I & J,902

A,Design of main propulsion system for a reusable suborbital rocket,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/design-of-main-propulsion-system-for-a-reusable-suborbital-rocket,"In recent years there has been an increased interest in the use of CubeSats to perform research in the realms of microgravity and earth observation. Previously, CubeSats have generally been placed into orbit as secondary payloads, piggy-backing on the launches of larger spacecraft. This has meant that CubeSat orbits and launch schedules have been decided by the requirements of other missions, restricting the manner in which they can be used. Due to the lack of flexibility in mission design afforded by traditional launch options, and the increasing competition for CubeSat launch spots, it has become desirable to develop a dedicated small satellite launch platform. This would allow for the execution of more novel and exciting missions, utilising orbits specifically designed with small satellites in mind. Tranquility Aerospace Ltd are currently engaged in the design of a two-stage vertical take-off and landing (VTVL) launcher, aimed at the small satellite market. Due to the many engineering challenges involved, they are aiming to first develop a suborbital launch vehicle in order to test the technologies necessary. This launch vehicle will be single-stage, and capable of vertical take-off and landing. As a student project at the University of Strathclyde, the main rocket propulsion system for this vehicle is being designed. This paper will outline the development of the propulsion system, including the propellant feed system, injector plate, thrust chamber and thermal control system. The key design driver is to lower the overall system mass, including the mass of the propellant. Comparisons of the impact of different subsystem configurations on performance will be assessed and discussed, and a focus will be placed on aspects of the design impacted by the requirement for reusability. The goal is to produce a fully workable design which is ready for manufacture and can be taken forward to the testing phase of development.",B & C & D,814
E,The influence of urban form on car travel following residential relocation: a current and retrospective study in Scottish urban areas,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-urban-form-on-car-travel-following-residential-r,"Spatial planning and spatial policy continues to be used as a tool to bring about changes in travel behaviour. Policy suggests that by creating particular urban forms, demand for travel by car can be reduced. This paper uses data collected in 2006 from 280 households in Glasgow and Edinburgh to analyse the relationships between urban form and vehicle miles driven, with an emphasis on those who had recently relocated. Population densities, housing type, distance to urban centre and measures of mix were collected for the current residential location and previous, for those who had relocated in the previous three years. An ordinal regression model of change in urban form showed significant associations with reported change in miles driven, although the effect was small compared with the effects of socio-economic factors and car ownership. While the results give some weight to intensification as a policy to bring about a reduction in average distance driven, there may be an increase in distance driven in the intensified area. Whether or not such intensification can be enacted against a backdrop of preferences towards suburban, car oriented living is contentious. As such, this study calls into question the use of planning policy as a means to reduce car use in Scottish cities.",E & F,119
C,Vibration-based health monitoring approach for composite structures using multivatiate statistical analysis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/vibration-based-health-monitoring-approach-for-composite-structur,"In this paper a novel procedure for damage assessment is suggested which is based on singular spectrum analysis (SSA). The main feature of the method is that it applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the lagged time series, obtained from the measured structural vibration response. In this study the methodology is developed for the case of a free decay response. The measured acceleration vectors are transformed into the frequency domain and then used to define a trajectory matrix. The covariance matrix of the trajectory matrix is decomposed into new variables, the Principal Components (PCs). They define a new space of linearly correlated variables onto which the dynamics/motion of the system can be projected. This decomposition is used to uncover oscillation patterns among other purposes. The method is applied and demonstrated for the case of a simple 2-DoF system. To demonstrate its capabilities for damage diagnosis different levels of stiffness reduction are introduced. The first two PCs are used to visually demonstrate the abilities of the methodology. The Mahalanobis distance is used to develop a classification system to detect and localize delamination in the 2-DoF system. The results clearly demonstrate the capabilities of the system to clearly detect and localize damage.",H & J,174
C,A nonlinear dynamic finite element approach for simulating muscular hydrostats,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-nonlinear-dynamic-finite-element-approach-for-simulating-muscul,"An implicit nonlinear finite element model for simulating biological muscle mechanics is developed. The numerical method is suitable for dynamic simulations of three-dimensional, nonlinear, nearly incompressible, hyperelastic materials that undergo large deformations. These features characterise biological muscles, which consist of fibres and connective tissues. It can be assumed that the stress distribution inside the muscles is the superposition of stresses along the fibres and the connective tissues. The mechanical behaviour of the surrounding tissues is determined by adopting a Mooney-Rivlin constitutive model, while the mechanical description of fibres is considered to be the sum of active and passive stresses. Due to the nonlinear nature of the problem, evaluation of the Jacobian matrix is carried out in order to subsequently utilise the standard Newton-Raphson iterative procedure and to carry out time integration with an implicit scheme. The proposed methodology is implemented into our in-house, open source, finite element software, which is validated by comparing numerical results with experimental measurements and other numerical results. Finally, the numerical procedure is utilised to simulate primitive octopus arm manoeuvres, such as bending and reaching.",L & K & C,609
D,Setting research agendas for productivity management in services,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/setting-research-agendas-for-productivity-management-in-services,"This paper presents a novel perspective of service productivity management and proposes a number of research agendas in this still evolving area of study. The paper is based on the views of top senior managers in twelve service sectors. The interviews were analyzed using a number of methods, including within-case and cross-case tables, coding and mapping. This qualitative analysis resulted in three main findings. First, the „organizational background‟ of a service sector proves to have significant effect on the approach to productivity management. Second, service sectors fall in different groups based on their operational features in the context of productivity with each group showing specific operational features. Finally, in some service operations there seems to be little or no trade-offs between productivity and quality. Each of the above topics brings their own insights into the area of service productivity which lead to a number of research agendas. The proposed research topics will provide a new framework for research into the difficult and often ignored subject of service productivity.",A & D,716
E,Dynamic properties of angular vertical comb-drive scanning micromirrors with electrothermally controlled variable offset,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dynamic-properties-of-angular-vertical-comb-drive-scanning-microm,"This paper presents the investigation of a variable angular vertical comb-drive (AVC) actuated MEMS scanning micromirror, focusing on the influence of the initial comb offset on the dynamic scan characteristics. Continuous control of the fixed comb initial vertical offset is achieved using an electrothermal actuator integrated in the AVC. Electro-thermo-mechanical simulations and experiments of the AVC structure show good agreement, with the initial vertical offset of the fixed comb reducing theoretically from 10.8 μm (0 mW to actuator) to 6.0 μm (500 mW to actuator) and experimentally from 10.4 μm (0 mW to actuator) to 4.9 μm (510 mW to actuator). Experimentally, a change of the initial vertical comb-offset from 10.4 μm to 4.9 μm leads to a reduction of the measured dynamic total optical scan angle (TOSA) from 27° to 19° for 100 V ac actuation. In addition, a mechanically assisted deflection of the AVC actuators to achieve an almost in-plane comb configuration further reduces the measured dynamic TOSA to about 3°. The overall device behavior is modeled using a hybrid simulation approach combining FEM analysis of the AVC capacitance with an analytical solution of the motion equation of the scanner. The analysis show good agreement, with the experimentally measured characteristics; overall showing an increased TOSA with higher initial comb offsets.",F & L & B,236
A,Incentive compensation vs. SOX: evidence from corporate acquisition decisions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/incentive-compensation-vs-sox-evidence-from-corporate-acquisition,"We empirically examine the impact of incentive compensation on the riskiness of acquisition decisions before and after the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX). Controlling for confounding events, firm characteristics and industry fixed effects, we find a substantial change in the relation between equity-related compensation and acquisition risk post-SOX stemming from a previously unidentified shift in the effectiveness of executive stock options to control managerial risk aversion. Not only has incentive compensation failed to offset the adverse impact of SOX on risk-taking activity but it has also significantly altered managerial incentives. The decrease in acquisition risk post-SOX cannot be solely attributed to changes in the structure of executive compensation but it additionally stems from the way managers perceive compensation-based incentives in the new regulatory environment. The results are robust to different measures of acquisition risk and alternative definitions of incentive compensation.",E,400
B,Singular spectrum analysis for hyperspectral imaging based beef eating quality evaluation: a new pre-processing method,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/singular-spectrum-analysis-for-hyperspectral-imaging-based-beef-e,"Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging platform technology that integrates conventional imaging and spectroscopy to attain both spatial and spectral information from an object. In recent years, HSI has rapidly matured into one of the most powerful tools for food quality analysis and control. In the project, HSI has been applied for beef eating quality evaluation. Pre-processing of HSI spectral profiles is needed, in order to eliminate undesired noises. Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) will be demonstrated to be an effective pre-processing step in de-noising HSI spectra.",A,364
A,Isogeometric boundary-element analysis for the wave-resistance problem using T-splines,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/isogeometric-boundary-element-analysis-for-the-wave-resistance-pr,"In this paper we couple collocated Boundary Element Methods (BEM) with unstructured analysis-suitable T-spline surfaces for solving a linear Boundary Integral Equation (BIE) arising in the context of a ship-hydrodynamic problem, namely the so-called Neumann–Kelvin problem, following the formulation by Brard (1972) and Baar and Price (1988). The local-refinement capabilities of the adopted T-spline bases, which are used for representing both the geometry of the hull and approximating the solution of the associated BIE, in accordance with the Isogeometric concept proposed by Hughes et al. (2005), lead to a solver that achieves the same error level for many fewer degrees of freedom as compared with the corresponding NURBS-based Isogeometric-BEM solver recently developed in Belibassakis et al. (2013). In this connection, this paper makes a step towards integrating modern CAD representations for ship-hulls with hydrodynamic solvers of improved accuracy and efficiency, which is a prerequisite for building efficient ship-hull optimizers.",G & H,775
A,Singular spectrum analysis  for identifying structural nonlinearity using free-decay responses: Application detection and diagnosis in composite laminates,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/singular-spectrum-analysis-for-identifying-structural-nonlinearit,"This investigation considers a methodology for analysis of the vibratory response of composite laminate structures which is based on Singular Spectrum Analysis. Composite laminate structures generally demonstrate nonlinear dynamic behaviour as a result of their intrinsic material nonlinear nature. Since the nonlinearities on a number of occasions induce relativity small changes in the vibratory response which are difficult to identify, the raw measured dynamic responses have to be subjected to certain pre-treatment before it can be used for purposes of nonlinearity and damage analysis. To approach this problem this work investigates the effect of some key signal and transformation parameters, such as signal length and sampling frequency as well as the SSA window length on the performance of the methodology itself. The selection of these parameters has a direct influence on the damage sensitivity and the accuracy of the methodology. The variation of these parameters can produce radical changes on the clustering effect of the methodology and it is demonstrated that this might affect the results interpretation.",I & C & M,349
B,Ocean acidification impacts mussel control on biomineralisation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/ocean-acidification-impacts-mussel-control-on-biomineralisation,"Ocean acidification is altering the oceanic carbonate saturation state and threatening the survival of marine calcifying organisms. Production of their calcium carbonate exoskeletons is dependent not only on the environmental seawater carbonate chemistry but also the ability to produce biominerals through proteins. We present shell growth and structural responses by the economically important marine calcifier Mytilus edulis to ocean acidification scenarios (380, 550, 750, 1000≈ atm pCO 2). After six months of incubation at 750≈ atm pCO 2, reduced carbonic anhydrase protein activity and shell growth occurs in M. edulis. Beyond that, at 1000≈ atm pCO 2, biomineralisation continued but with compensated metabolism of proteins and increased calcite growth. Mussel growth occurs at a cost to the structural integrity of the shell due to structural disorientation of calcite crystals. This loss of structural integrity could impact mussel shell strength and reduce protection from predators and changing environments.",L,832

These are the monohydrate and methanol hemisolvate forms of the chloride (2-{[(4-azaniumylphenyl)sulfonyl]azanidyl}pyrimidin-1-ium chloride monohydrate, C10H11N4O2S+·Cl−·H2O, (I), and 2-{[(4-azaniumylphenyl)sulfonyl]azanidyl}pyrimidin-1-ium chloride methanol hemisolvate, C10H11N4O2S+·Cl−·0.5CH3OH, (II)); a bromide monohydrate (2-{[(4-azaniumylphenyl)sulfonyl]azanidyl}pyrimidin-1-ium bromide monohydrate, C10H11N4O2S+·Br−·H2O, (III)), which has a disordered water channel; a species containing the unusual tetraiodide dianion [bis(2-{[(4-azaniumylphenyl)sulfonyl]azanidyl}pyrimidin-1-ium) tetraiodide, 2C10H11N4O2S+·I42−, (IV)], where the [I4]2− ion is located at a crystallographic inversion centre; a tetrafluoroborate monohydrate (2-{[(4-azaniumylphenyl)sulfonyl]azanidyl}pyrimidin-1-ium tetrafluoroborate monohydrate, C10H11N4O2S+·BF4−·H2O, (V)); a nitrate (2-{[(4-azaniumylphenyl)sulfonyl]azanidyl}pyrimidin-1-ium nitrate, C10H11N4O2S+·NO3−, (VI)); an ethanesulfonate {4-[(pyrimidin-2-yl)sulfamoyl]anilinium ethanesulfonate, C10H11N4O2S+·C2H5SO3−, (VII)}; and a dihydrate of the 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate {4-[(pyrimidin-2-yl)sulfamoyl]anilinium 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonate dihydrate, C10H11N4O2S+·HOC6H4SO3−·2H2O, (VIII)}. All these structures feature alternate layers of cations and of anions where any solvent is associated with the anion layers. The two sulfonate salts are protonated at the aniline N atom and the amide N atom of sulfadiazine, a tautomeric form of the sulfadiazine cation that has not been crystallographically described before. All the other salt forms are instead protonated at the aniline group and on one N atom of the pyrimidine ring. Whilst all eight species are based upon hydrogen-bonded centrosymetric dimers with graph set R22(8), the two sulfonate structures also differ in that these dimers do not link into one-dimensional chains of cations through NH3-to-SO2 hydrogen-bonding interactions, whilst the other six species do. The chloride methanol hemisolvate and the tetraiodide are isostructural and a packing analysis of the cation positions shows that the chloride monohydrate structure is also closely related to these.",D & L,966

With the changing nature of education in Scottish schools because of the Curriculum for Excellence and the requirement for increasing, the number of students who participate in STEM subjects at university. An eight-person research team was assembled at the University of Strathclyde to investigate, support and raise awareness of the key factors affecting successful STEM transition from secondary school to university. The group made up from students and academics was a novel approach and aimed at developing their knowledge of the current Scottish education system whilst developing partnerships with secondary schools in the local Glasgow area.
Several peer discussion groups were conducted as part of the methodology and it was through these that ideas, such as a student elective scheme allowing university students to enter schools and run project based learning workshops, could benefit the transition strategy for young people to enter the STEM based disciplines at university. The outlined proposals, when implemented, have the possibility of negating the previous inconsistency of previous attempts to address the problem of successful STEM transition. Four key project deliverables were identified that had the potential to develop the strategy necessary to encourage and develop school pupils into the STEM subject areas and with the
help of staff and pupils, the researchers were able to identify potential ideas and solutions to facilitate this.",H & L,355
C,A multidirectional Physarum solver for the automated design of space trajectories,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-multidirectional-physarum-solver-for-the-automated-design-of-sp-2,This paper proposes a bio-inspired algorithm to automatically generate optimal multi-gravity assist trajectories. The multi-gravity assist problem has some analogies with the better known Traveling Salesman Problem and can be addressed with similar strategies. An algorithm drawing inspiration from the Physarum slime mould is proposed to grow and explore a tree of decisions that corresponds to the possible sequences of transfers from one planet to another. Some examples show that the proposed bio-inspired algorithm can produce solutions that are better than the ones generated by humans or with Hidden Genes Genetic Algorithms.,D,499
D,Online AMR domestic load profile characteristic change monitor to support ancillary demand services,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/online-amr-domestic-load-profile-characteristic-change-monitor-to,"With conventional generation capacity being constrained on environmental grounds and  renewable alternatives carrying capacity uncertainties, increasingly accurate forecasts of demand are likely to be required in future power systems: highly distributed renewable generation penetrating low voltage networks must be matched to small dynamic loads, while spinning reserves of conventional generation that are required to maintain security of supply, must be reduced to more efficient margins. Domestic loads, likely to form significant proportions of the loads on islanded power systems such as those in remote rural communities, are currently modeled with homogenous and coarse load profiles developed from aggregated data. An objective of AMR deployment is to clarify the nature and variability of the residential LV customer. In this paper, an algorithm for tracking the consistency of the behavior of small loads is presented. This would allow them to be assessed for their availability to provide demand services to the grid. In the method presented, significant changes in behavior are detected using Bayesian changepoint analysis which tracks a multivariate Gaussian representation of a residential load profile on a day to day basis. A hypothetical single phase feeder, representative of an islanded rural power system, is used to illustrate the detected heterogeneity of load behavior consistency.",C,577

Using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and a mouse model of pressure overload mediated hypertrophy, we show that peptide disruption of the HSP20–phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) complex results in attenuation of action potential prolongation and protection against adverse cardiac remodelling. The later was evidenced by improved contractility, decreased heart weight to body weight ratio, and reduced interstitial and perivascular fibrosis.

B,Increased waterborne blaNDM-1 resistance gene abundances associated with seasonal human pilgrimages to the Upper Ganges River,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/increased-waterborne-blandm-1-resistance-gene-abundances-associat,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) is often rooted in inappropriate antibiotic use, but poor water quality and inadequate sanitation exacerbate the problem, especially in emerging countries. An example is increasing multi-AR due to mobile carbapenemases, such as NDM-1 protein (coded by blaNDM-1 genes), which can produce extreme drug-resistant phenotypes. In 2010, NDM-1 positive isolates and blaNDM-1 genes were detected in surface waters across Delhi and have since been detected across the urban world. However, little is known about blaNDM-1 levels in more pristine locations, such as the headwaters of the Upper Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages in May/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we quantified blaNDM-1 abundances, other AR genes (ARG) and coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast blaNDM-1 levels and water quality conditions between season and region. Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all sites), and blaNDM-1 abundances were high across sites in water (5.4 ± 0.4 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1); 95% confidence interval) and sediment (6.3 ± 0.7 log(blaNDM-1·mg-1)) samples from both seasons. In contrast, water column blaNDM-1 abundances were very low across all sites (2.1 ± 0.6 log(blaNDM-1·mL-1)) in February in the Upper Ganges and water quality was good (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita blaNDM-1 levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column relative to February and blaNDM-1 levels significantly correlated with fecal coliform levels (r=0.61; p=0.007). Given waste management infrastructure is limited in Rishikesh-Haridwar; data imply blaNDM-1 levels are higher in visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in seasonally higher blaNDM-1 levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas without adequate waste treatment are possible ""hot spots"" for AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.",E & F,459

A,Contribution of human factors to fishing vessel accidents and near misses in the UK,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/contribution-of-human-factors-to-fishing-vessel-accidents-and-nea,"The research paper in hand presents a thorough exploration of the fishing vessel accidents and near misses in the UK fishing industry as well as the underlying human element factors and sub-factors contributing to them. In this respect, the regulatory regime in the fishing industry both at national and international level is initially examined while also complemented by the investigation of past research efforts to address these issues. Furthermore, the analysis of the fishing vessels accidents and near misses as recorded in the UK MAIB (Marine Accident Investigation Branch) database for a period of 19 years is performed in order to derive the causal factors leading to the fishing vessel accidents. It is initially shown that the fatalities and injuries taking place due to fishing vessels’ accidents have alarmingly remained unchanged over the last 15-20 years. Another key finding is that the number of accidents and near misses per day and night shifts is quite similar while most accidents take place in coastal waters. Furthermore, human factors are related to the vast majority of fishing vessels accidents with the principal ones referring to “non-compliance”, “equipment misuse or poorly designed”, “training” and “competence”. Finally, remedial measures are also suggested in order to address the main accident causes identified.",M & I,743
E,Outlook and appraisal [June 2014],https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/outlook-and-appraisal-june-2014,"In 2013 Scottish GDP grew at 1.6% a little less than the 1.7% outturn in the UK. This suggests that without the loss of output due to the dispute at Grangemouth in October 2013, Scottish growth would have equalled that of the UK. Positive growth has now been recorded for the Scottish economy in the previous 7 quarters. But to reiterate our previous warnings: the recovery continues to be considerably weaker than that of any recession in the last 70 to 80 years (i.e since the 1930’s). In the fourth quarter, GDP in Scotland was -0.9% below its pre-recession peak, whereas UK GDP stood at -1.4% below its pre-recession peak of more than 5 years ago. However, due to the greater fall in UK output during the recession, recovery from the recession has been stronger in the UK.",B & L,742

Following a comprehensive process of academic review of articles and research work submitted to the journal, it has succeeded to secure its position in various databases. One of the unique features of the Archnet-IJAR was, and still is, the voluntary work nature of its editors and reviewers where no funds are involved at all in managing or reviewing or editing the submissions before publishing. Another unique feature is that the journal since the beginning was, and still is, made available for free without subscription fees or publishing fees. A third feature of Archnet-IJAR is the opportunity it offers to young academics, PhD scholars, reaching across the boundaries of cultures and regions.

Key highlights in the past seven years are important to note. In qualitative and quantitative terms the journal has made significant achievements. In terms of quality the journal became part of important data and index bases including Avery index to Architectural Periodicals, EBSCO-Current Abstracts-Art and Architecture, INTUTE, Directory of Open Access Journals, Pro-Quest, Scopus-Elsevier and many university library databases.

Their consent, compliance and cooperation is therefore necessary to achieving these outcomes and yet, when it comes to very high risk sexual and violent offenders, in the pursuit of community safety, control oriented, preventative practices predominate over change focused, participatory approaches. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 professionals' and 26 service users' to explore how, under the auspices of MAPPA, the supervisory process is enacted and experienced and the extent and means through which it affects people’s willingness to accept or invest in not only the process but the purpose of supervision. It is argued that how the process of community supervision is experienced and what it comprises, not only shapes the outcomes of supervision, but also the nature of consent, compliance and cooperation. We conclude by advocating for more participatory processes and practices to promote service users' active engagement in, and ownership of, the process of change, and in that, the realisation of both the normative dimensions and intended outcomes of community supervision.",A & G,356

Concentrations of benzene, toluene and o-xylene at mg kg-1levels in ethanol were determined from continuous vaporisation of the liquid. Ions with m/z values of 39, 57, 73, 77, 78, 91, 92 and 106 were selected and the optimal regression model (multiple linear regression with mean-centring) was found using an automated design of experiments approach to calibration model selection. It was discovered that the linearity of the response allowed excellent calibration to be performed using only four standards (at 0 and 110 mg kg-1for each of the three analytes) and that there were minimal inter-analyte interferences. The detection limit of benzene, toluene and o-xylene was 0.5, 0.8 and 0.5 mg kg-1, respectively. Average differences between the actual and predicted concentrations, expressed as a percentage of the actual concentrations, for 27-82 mg kg-1of benzene, toluene and o-xylene were 0.5-1.4%, 0.0-0.4% and 0.3-1.6%, respectively, while the average relative standard deviations were 1.3-2.6%, 1.0-2.5% and 1.1-2.3%, respectively. Detection of 3 mg kg-1changes in the concentration of each of the analytes (at the 36 mg kg-1level) was also demonstrated, indicating the sensitivity of the technique and the potential ability of the procedure to detect minor deviations in the specification of process streams from continuous analysis.",D,170

B,Effects of temperature and concentration on mechanism and kinetics of thermally induced deposition from coffee extracts,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effects-of-temperature-and-concentration-on-mechanism-and-kinetic,"Production of soluble (instant) coffee powders typically involves extraction of roasted coffee by water followed by evaporation in order to concentrate extracts before spray or freeze drying to produce dry coffee powder. In the course of evaporation, deposition of dissolved material from coffee extracts is a major cause of fouling at the heat exchange surfaces of evaporators. Therefore, in order to improve the design and optimization of evaporation processes of coffee extracts, better understanding of the deposition mechanism and kinetics is needed. In this study, optical waveguide lightmode spectroscopy (OWLS) was used to monitor the initial formation of nanometer scale deposits on surfaces exposed to coffee extracts. OWLS measurements were complemented by light scattering from extract solutions, gravimetry of macroscopic deposits, and scanning electron microscopy imaging of deposited layers. Primary molecular-scale layers of about 1 mg m^−2 were rapidly formed in the first stage of deposition, even at ambient temperature, followed by the secondary deposition with kinetics strongly dependent on temperature. Secondary deposition rates were low and largely independent of the extract concentration at ambient temperature, but became strongly dependent on the extract concentration at elevated temperatures. In particular, activation energies for the deposition between 25◦C and 70◦C were much higher for the original extract (13.3 mass %, solids) than for diluted extracts (up to 1.3 mass %, solids). Furthermore, heating of the original extracts above 60◦C resulted in rapid aggregation of suspended macromolecules into large clusters, while only gradual aggregation was observed in diluted extracts.",M & I,351

Due to the need for accurate dosimetry of small field size VHEE beams we have performed dose measurements using EBT2 Gafchromic® film. Calibration of the film has been carried out for beams of two different energy ranges: 20 MeV and 165 MeV from conventional radio frequency linear accelerators. In addition, EBT2 film has been used for dose measurements with 135 MeV electron beams produced by a laser-plasma wakefield accelerator. The dose response measurements and percentage depth dose profiles have been compared with calculations carried out using the general-purpose FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) radiation transport code. The impact of induced radioactivity on film response for VHEEs has been evaluated using the MC simulations. A neutron yield of the order of 10-5 neutrons cm-2 per incident electron has been estimated and induced activity due to radionuclide production is found to have a negligible effect on total dose deposition and film response. Neutron and proton contribution to the equivalent doses are negligible for VHEE. The study demonstrates that EBT2 Gafchromic film is a reliable dosimeter that can be used for dosimetry of VHEE. The results indicate an energy-independent response of the dosimeter for 20 MeV and 165 MeV electron beams and has been found to be suitable for dosimetry of VHEE.",B & L,471
C,Self-learning load characteristic models for smart appliances,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/self-learning-load-characteristic-models-for-smart-appliances,"It is generally accepted that if dynamic electricity pricing tariffs were to be introduced, their effectiveness in controlling domestic loads will be curtailed if consumers were relied on to respond in their own interests. The complexities of relating behavior to load to price are so burdensome that at least some degree of automation would be required to take advantage of pricing signals. However, a major issue with home automation is fitting in with the lifestyles of individual consumers. Truly smart appliances that can learn the details of their routine operation may be several years away from widespread adoption making integrated home energy management systems unfeasible. Similarly, usage patterns of these same appliances may be substantially different from household to household. The contribution of this paper is the proposal and demonstration of a set of probabilistic models that act in a framework to reduce appliance usage data into contextual knowledge that accounts for variability in patterns in usage.

However, at present, the scope of interoperability is constrained to communications data, such as Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Events (GOOSE) messaging, and has not been extended to protection setting information. The protection functions are implemented using proprietary parameters and are typically stored in vendor-specific binary files, which make it very difficult to manipulate these data directly from external applications. Engineers must also understand the meaning and implications of modification of all proprietary setting parameters and often need to be trained in the use of vendor-specific tools, which is time consuming and potentially increases the risk of introducing protection setting errors. Furthermore, the existing IED configuration process is complex, involves many steps, and requires the use of various software tools. 
To address these problems, this paper proposes the use of the IEC 61850 data model and System Configuration description Language (SCL) to represent protection settings. The proprietary protection settings data are mapped to the IEC 61850 standardised data and saved as SCL files. The common representation of protection settings in SCL files can also be interpreted and converted back to proprietary settings, thus achieving protection setting interoperability.  A prototype tool that implements the process has been developed and demonstrated by the authors. In the paper, the entire process is described using examples. 
The SCL files, based on an XML syntax that can be easily manipulated automatically by applications such as protection coordination tools, are used to streamline the existing IED configuration process. A simplified IED configuration process using the SCL based setting files is proposed in the paper. Compared with the existing process, the new process is significantly streamlined, and permits an IED-independent system configuration tool to carry out the entire configuration process. No proprietary software or communications are needed. It also allows the protection settings to be performed at a system level, rather than individually on a “per device” basis. 
The key challenges that must be addressed in order for the proposed process to be widely adopted are: the IEC 61850 data model for protection settings is not complete; vendors may prefer to maintain proprietary formats; the data model should have the capability to be extended for future protection functions. This paper reports the progress towards addressing these challenges.",A & G,209
D,Appropriate means of frequency measurement for the provision of inertial response from a wind turbine,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/appropriate-means-of-frequency-measurement-for-the-provision-of-i,"A means of manipulating the power output of an individual wind turbine has been developed at the University of Strathclyde. This model takes into account the wind turbine dynamics. However, in order to enable such a control strategy to provide inertial response, the system needs to be coupled to control systems that monitor a power system. For inertial response, it is important that the wind turbine control strategy be made aware of changes in the power system as quickly as possible such that a change in power output (akin to inertial response) can be delivered in less than 200ms. This work focuses on monitoring power system frequency.",H & L,962

By carrying-out Breit-Pauli and intermediate coupling frame transformation (ICFT) R-matrix calculations for the electron-impact excitation of Fe2 +, which both use the exact same atomic structure and the same close-coupling expansion, we demonstrate the validity of the application of the powerful ICFT method to low-charge iron group ions. This is in contradiction to the finding of Bautista et al., who carried-out ICFT and Dirac R-matrix calculations for the same ion. We discuss possible reasons.",D,387
C,Highly anisotropic metasurface: a polarized beam splitter and hologram,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/highly-anisotropic-metasurface-a-polarized-beam-splitter-and-holo,"Two-dimensional metasurface structures have recently been proposed to reduce the challenges of fabrication of traditional plasmonic metamaterials. However, complex designs and sophisticated fabrication procedures are still required. Here, we present a unique one-dimensional (1-D) metasurface based on bilayered metallic nanowire gratings, which behaves as an ideal polarized beam splitter, producing strong negative reflection for transverse-magnetic (TM) light and efficient reflection for transverse-electric (TE) light. The large anisotropy resulting from this TE-metal-like/TM-dielectric-like feature can be explained by the dispersion curve based on the Bloch theory of periodic metal-insulator-metal waveguides. The results indicate that this photon manipulation mechanism is fundamentally different from those previously proposed for 2-D or 3-D metastructures. Based on this new material platform, a novel form of metasurface holography is proposed and demonstrated, in which an image can only be reconstructed by using a TM light beam. By reducing the metamaterial structures to 1-D, our metasurface beam splitter exhibits the qualities of cost-efficient fabrication, robust performance, and high tunability, in addition to its applicability over a wide range of working wavelengths and incident angles. This development paves a foundation for metasurface structure designs towards practical metamaterial applications.",C,717

C,Coping with career boundaries and boundary-crossing in the graduate labour market,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/coping-with-career-boundaries-and-boundary-crossing-in-the-gradua,"Purpose: This article explores the nature and role of career boundaries for enabling/constraining career self-management for occupational boundary-crossing in the UK graduate labour market.
Methodology: The data is provided by career history interviews with 36 UK graduates. The analysis contrasts transitions for those who started careers in low- intermediate- and high-skilled segments of the labour market.
Findings: Availability of development and progression opportunities were the most prominent career boundary experienced. Ease of boundary-crossing differed by career stage and educational background. Boundaries enabled career self-management by acting as psychological/external push factors, but push factors only aided progression to high-skilled segments for a third of graduates who started careers in underemployment. For the rest, an adaptation of expectations to labour market realities was observed.
Research limitations/implications: Although career history interviews limit generalisability, they contextualise boundaries and deepen understanding of career actors’ subjective experiences and responses.   
Practical implications: The study highlights the role of labour market and demand-side constraints for career transitions as well as proactive career behaviours. This has implications for career counsellors, employers and individuals.
Originality/value: This article provides a distinctive ‘boundary-focused’ analysis of emerging career boundaries in the graduate labour market. The findings point to the intricate interplay between structure and agency for career development.",M & I,103

Through a qualitative content analysis of 200 posts from across Internet groups, we identify topics and information needs expressed by people who feel they have no other sources of support available to them. We uncover various health, wellbeing, social and identity issues which are not only crucial to the lives of the people posting, but which they are unwilling to risk revealing elsewhere – offering evidence that these online environments provide an outlet for the expression of needs in situations of critical and hidden information need. To enable this analysis, we first describe our method for reliably identifying situations of information poverty in messages posted to these groups and our coding approach. Our work contributes to the study of both information seeking within the context of information poverty and the use of Internet groups as sources of information and support, bridging the two by exploring the manifestation of information poverty in this particular online setting.",B & L,876

We focus specifically on the use of EPM which is used to identify a proportion of the workforce as ‘underperformers', often referred to as forced distribution rating systems. Evidence is presented from union informants representing employees in two technologically-intensive service sectors: the financial sector and telecommunications. These sectors were amongst the first to utilize technology in a way which had transformative implications for work processes and people management in white-collar service work. In both sectors and across clerical and engineering work contexts, the data show the use of EPM by managers to guide punitive performance management for sickness absence and perceived reduced capability. Older workers emerge as a vulnerable group, with manager decisions shown to be based on age stereotypes. We argue that increasingly pervasive use of digitized performance monitoring may intensify age discrimination in performance management.",E & A,359

The effect of various parameters such as reaction temperature, feed molar ratio (FMR) of 4-VCH to TBHP and catalyst loading on the conversion of TBHP to 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexane 1,2-epoxide (4-VCH 1,2-epoxide) was studied to optimize reaction conditions in a batch reactor. The long-term stability of Ps.AMP.Mo was evaluated by recycling a sample of the catalyst several times in batch experiments. A detailed evaluation of Mo leaching from the polymer supported catalyst was investigated by isolating any residue from reaction supernatant solutions and then using these residues as potential catalysts in epoxidation reactions. The efficiency of Ps.AMP.Mo catalyst for continuous epoxidation studies was assessed using a FlowSyn continuous flow reactor by studying the effect of reaction temperature, feed flow rate and FMR of 4-VCH to TBHP on the conversion of TBHP and the yield of 4-VCH 1,2-epoxide.

D,Comparison between near infrared spectroscopy and hyperspectral imaging in predicting beef eating quality,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/comparison-between-near-infrared-spectroscopy-and-hyperspectral-i,"Consumer perception of beef quality has been shown to be largely dependent upon three factors, which are tenderness, juiciness and flavour. Usually, objective  evaluation of tenderness can be achieved by measuring the mechanical properties of the beef sample using slice shear force (SSF). The other two factors, juiciness and  flavour are assessed by a sensory taste panel. Ultimate pH has a relationship to both juiciness and tenderness.  However, both shear force tests and pH tests are  unfeasible for fast-paced industry on-line use because they are costly, time-consuming and destructive. Thus, the aim of the present experiment was to develop  an efficient approach to quantify shear force and pH as indicators of beef eating quality.",D,901
A,Quantification of supply chain risks: development and application of a novel risk management framework,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/quantification-of-supply-chain-risks-development-and-application-,"Purpose: Supply chain risk management is still an active area of research that necessitates application of existing risk quantification techniques in established fields for potential application in the research area. This study is focused on bridging the research gap through development of a novel risk management framework that merges the two quantitative techniques of Bayesian belief network and Game theory. Bayesian belief networks capture the interdependency between various risk factors while Game theory models the risks associated with conflicting incentives of stakeholders in a supply network. The proposed framework segregates risk drivers, events and consequences and captures their interdependency. Development project of Boeing 787 aircraft was a unique venture in terms of its unconventional supply chain and unproven technology. Instead of the realization of anticipated shorter development time and reduced costs, the project turned out to be a fiasco. A new term ‘game theoretic risks’ has been coined to acknowledge the risks associated with conflicting incentives of various stakeholders in a supply network. 

Research Approach: This study has focused on a review of the literature for establishing the research gap followed by designing of a novel framework (conceptual model) for quantification and management of supply chain risks. Subsequently, the model has been applied on the development project of Boeing 787 aircraft.

Findings and Originality: The developed framework is unique in its design merging two quantitative techniques in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management. Application of the novel framework on a case study of Boeing 787 project revealed its merits in terms of capturing the dynamics of interacting risk factors. Bayesian belief network is a useful modelling technique for risk quantification capturing the interdependency between various risks. Game theoretic modelling provides an opportunity to model the risks associated with conflicting incentives of the stakeholders within a supply network. Game theory based modelling captured the behaviour of suppliers in relation to the uncertainty about cost functions and the final response of Boeing to the delays caused by suppliers. The results clearly manifested importance of the game theoretic risks and as there was no policy to align the incentives of suppliers in Boeing 787 project, there was a major delay causing financial penalty to Boeing. Furthermore, lack of management expertise in Supply Chain Risk Management was a major factor for the higher development cost. It has been proved that lack of information in a supply chain affects the desired objectives of a project. To our best knowledge, such a framework has never been developed and applied in the field of Supply Chain Risk Management.

Research Impact: The output of this study will help researchers model the supply chain risks in a more realistic way and stimulate further research in this direction.

Practical Impact: The application of our developed model on a case study reveals its practical impact. Had the Boeing considered the holistic view of the supply chain risks, the project delay and financial loss would not have materialized. Our model can be utilized in supply networks of other industries.",C,747

Our main result is a lower bound on this entanglement and resembles well-known entropic uncertainty relations. Besides its fundamental interest, this result directly bounds the effectiveness of sequential bipartite operations—corresponding to the measurement interactions—for entanglement generation.

The study found migration can have adverse effects on mental health and well-being, linked to people’s social circumstances such as racism and the asylum process and that this is exacerbated by stigma and discrimination. It suggests the importance of a socio-cultural context for understanding and addressing stigma, influenced by both social and cultural causal factors, including fear, past trauma, isolation, racism and the stress of the asylum process coupled with negative cultural beliefs about mental health problems.

B,Linking a storyline with multiple models: a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/linking-a-storyline-with-multiple-models-a-cross-scale-study-of-t,"State-of-the-art scenario exercises in the energy and environment fields argue for combining qualitative storylines with quantitative modelling. This paper proposes an approach for linking a highly detailed storyline with multiple, diverse models. This approach is illustrated through a cross-scale study of the UK power system transition until 2050. The storyline, called Central Co-ordination, is linked with insights from six power system models and two appraisal techniques. First, the storyline is 'translated' into harmonised assumptions on power system targets for the models. Then, a new concept called the landscape of models is introduced. This landscape helps to map the key fields of expertise of individual models, including their temporal, spatial and disciplinary foci. The storyline is then assessed based on the cross-scale modelling results. While the storyline is important for transmitting information about governance and the choices of key actors, many targets aspired in it are inconsistent with modelling results. The storyline overestimates demand reduction levels, uptake of marine renewables and irreplaceability of carbon capture and storage. It underestimates the supply–demand balancing challenge, the need for back-up capacity and the role of nuclear power and interconnectors with Europe. Thus, iteratively linking storylines and models is key.",F & K,390
B,An evolutionary approach to the solution of multi-objective min-max problems in evidence-based robust optimization,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-evolutionary-approach-to-the-solution-of-multi-objective-min-m,"This paper presents an evolutionary approach to solve the multi-objective min-max problem (MOMMP) that derives from the maximization of the Belief in robust design optimization. In evidence-based robust optimization, the solutions that minimize the design budgets are robust under epistemic uncertainty if they maximize the Belief in the realization of the value of the design budgets. Thus robust solutions are found by minimizing, with respect to the design variables, the global maximum with respect to the uncertain variables. This paper presents an algorithm to solve MOMMP, and a computational cost reduction technique based on Kriging metamodels. The results show that the algorithm is able to accurately approximate the Pareto front for a MOMMP at a fraction of the computational cost of an exact calculation.",M & I,725
D,A comparison of medication adherence/persistence for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the United Kingdom,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-comparison-of-medication-adherencepersistence-for-asthma-and-ch,"The aim of this article is to describe and compare adherence and persistence with maintenance therapies in patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the United Kingdom (UK).  A retrospective prescribing database cohort was obtained from 44 general practitioner surgeries in National Health Service Forth Valley Scotland. Patients with physician-diagnosed asthma or COPD who received maintenance therapy between January 2008 and December 2009 were included. Five classes of therapy were assessed: inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, combination therapy inhalers, theophyllines and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Adherence was calculated using the medication possession ratio (MPR) and persistence was determined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for the time to discontinuation (TTD) over 1 year. Two step-wise logistic regressions were performed to assess the contribution of diagnosis to adherence/persistence.  A total of 13,322 patients were included in the analysis: 10,521 patients with asthma and 2801 patients with COPD. 25.2% of medication episodes for asthma and 45.6% of medication episodes for COPD were classified as having an adequate medication supply (MPR of 80-120%). The overall median TTD was 92 days (IQR, interquartile range: 50-186 days) for patients with asthma and 116 days (IQR: 58-259 days, comparison p < 0.001) for patients with COPD. Patients with COPD were found to be more likely to achieve an MPR of at least 80% (OR: 1.27, 95% CI: 1.15-1.40), but had a similar likelihood of persistence at 1 year to patients with asthma.  Adherence and persistence with respiratory therapies in the UK is relatively low. There is suggestion that patients with COPD may display more adherent behaviours than patients with asthma.",B & L,357

The indirect savings are quantified through the social interactions people in the network. The example used in this paper illustrates the effectiveness of the model by identifying the households who should have free solar water heaters installed in their residential houses based on their influence through interactions in their community.

B,Effect of electric-current pulses on grain-structure evolution in cryogenically rolled copper,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effect-of-electric-current-pulses-on-grain-structure-evolution-in,"The effect of electric-current pulses on the evolution of microstructure and texture in cryogenically rolled copper was determined. The pulsed material was found to be completely recrystallized, and the recrystallization mechanism was deduced to be similar to that operating during conventional static annealing. The microstructural changes were explained simply in terms of Joule heating. A significant portion of the recrystallization process was concluded to have occurred after pulsing; i.e., during cooling to ambient temperature. The grain structure and microhardness were shown to vary noticeably in the heat-affected zone (HAZ); these observations mirrored variations of temper colors. Accordingly, the revealed microstructure heterogeneity was attributed to the inhomogeneous temperature distribution developed during pulsing. In the central part of the HAZ, the mean grain size increased with current density and this effect was associated with the temperature rise per se. This grain size was slightly smaller than that in statically recrystallized specimens.",D,172

The aim of this paper is to investigate this effect of PEF treatment on microalgae. The PEF system used in this paper consists of a pulse generator and treatment cell with parallel-plane metallic electrodes. The PEF treatment of microalgae, Spirulina, was conducted using 33.3- and 66.7-kV/cm electric field impulses. The efficiency of the PEF treatment for inactivation of microalgae was assessed by comparison of the growth curves of PEF-treated and untreated samples. Results showed that growth of microalgae can be stopped by the application between 100 and 500 high-field impulses with field magnitude 33.3 kV/cm. When the field is increased to a magnitude of 66.7 kV/cm, the growth of microalgae can be stopped by application of 50 impulses.

This work aimed to investigate specific root traits and to assess the effect of biochar amendment on contaminant availability.  Amendment with two different types of biochar, pine woodchip and olive tree pruning, was assessed in a rhizobox experiment with maize planted in a soil contaminated with significant levels of copper and arsenic.
Amendment was found to significantly improve root traits compared to the control soil, particularly root mass density and root length density. Copper uptake to plants and ammonium sulphate extractable copper was significantly less in the biochar amended soils. Arsenic uptake and extractability varied with type of biochar used but was not considered to be the limiting factor affecting root and shoot development.  Root establishment in contaminated soils can be enhanced by biochar amendment but choice of biochar is key to maximising soil improvement and controlling contaminant availability.",F & K,872

Speech and language therapists (SLTs), educational psychologists and teachers are sometimes called upon by caregivers to provide advice on whether or how children and young people with language impairments should be encouraged to use these media. This article aims to illuminate some of the key issues and to review the implications of different types of advice that practitioners might provide. Four broad strategies are considered: Prohibition, Laissez-faire, Restriction, and Constructive use. Possible consequences of each strategy are outlined and it is proposed that Constructive use should be the strategy of choice. Reasons in favour of a constructive orientation include the benefits of joint engagement, enjoyment, cognitive and perceptual challenges and social motivation; effective uses can support educational attainment in young people with language impairments. Some areas where children and young people with language impairments need support with new media are noted. Decisions that we make about whether to constrain or support uses of new media have direct implications for the quality of young people’s lives and futures.

The thus selected phages can be ampli-fied by infection of E.coli. These phages are shown to catalyze amide condensation and hydrolysis. Kinetic analysis shows a minor role for substrate binding. The approach enables discovery and mass-production of biocatalytic phages.",E & A,745
B,A study of clinical and information management processes in the surgical pre-assessment clinic,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-study-of-clinical-and-information-management-processes-in-the-s,"Establishing day-case surgery as the preferred hospital admission route for all eligible patients requires adequate preoperative assessment of patients in order to quickly distinguish those who will require minimum assessment and are suitable for day-case admission from those who will require more extensive management and will need to be admitted as inpatients. As part of a study to elucidate clinical and information management processes within the patient surgical pathway in NHS Scotland, we conducted a total of 10 in-depth semi-structured interviews during 4 visits to the Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary surgical pre-assessment clinic. We modelled clinical processes using process-mapping techniques and analysed interview data using qualitative methods. We used Normalisation Process Theory as a conceptual framework to interpret the factors which were identified as facilitating or hindering information elucidation tasks and communication within the multi-disciplinary team. The pre-assessment clinic of Dumfries & Galloway Royal Infirmary was opened in 2008 in response to clinical and workflow issues which had been identified with former patient management practices in the surgical pathway. The preoperative clinic now operates under well established processes and protocols. The use of a computerised system for managing preoperative documentation substantially transformed clinical practices and facilitates communication and information-sharing among the multi-disciplinary team.ConclusionSuccessful deployment and normalisation of innovative clinical and information management processes was possible because both local and national strategic priorities were synergistic and the system was developed collaboratively by the POA staff and the health-board IT team, resulting in a highly contextualised operationalisation of clinical and information management processes. Further concerted efforts from a range of stakeholders are required to fully integrate preoperative assessment within the health-board surgical care pathway. A substantial – yet unfulfilled – potential benefit in embedding information technology in routine use within the preoperative clinic would be to improve the reporting of surgical outcomes.",A & G,654

D,Motivating factors in online language teacher education in southern Argentina,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/motivating-factors-in-online-language-teacher-education-in-southe,"Online teacher education is of growing interest and so is the study of motivation as a key factor in technology-mediated learning environments. This study is based on a pre-service language teacher education programme in Patagonia, a southern Argentinian region with no face-to-face training offers, limited Internet access and a large number of unqualified teachers. Our goal is to broaden the understanding of online teacher education programmes at undergraduate level in contexts where most trainees are practicing teachers and where online education is the only possibility for holding a teaching qualification. We focused on the motivating factors that led 71 trainees to enrol and to remain in this online teacher training course. Through a mixed methods approach, the trainees completed an online survey (n 71) and participated in a follow-up interview (n 24). Results showed that obtaining a teaching degree, autonomy, and individual activities were key factors in initial and sustaining motivation. Participants’ experiences challenged collaborative learning in an online environment.",D,404
A,The influence of different dressings on the pH of the wound environment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-different-dressings-on-the-ph-of-the-wound-envir,"This study examines the effect of various wound dressings on the pH levels of a wound, using a simulated wound environment.  The pH levels of a 4 different wound dressings (manuka honey dressing, sodium carboxymethylcellulose hydrofiber dressing, polyhydrated ionogen-coated polymer mesh dressing, and a protease modulating collagen cellulose dressing) were tested in a simulated horse serum wound environment. The effect of local buffering was observed and pH changes in real time were measured.  All dressings were found to have low pH (below pH 4), with the lowest being the protease modulating collage cellulose dressing, with a pH of 2.3. The dressing with the strongest acid concentration was the polyhydrated, ionogen-coated, polymer mesh dressing.  The low pH and strong acidic nature of the dressing investigated indicate that they may play a role in influencing the healing process in a wound.",C,678
E,Viscoelastic instabilities in microscale flows,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/viscoelastic-instabilities-in-microscale-flows,"Many artificial and natural fluids contain macromolecules, particles or droplets that impart complex flow behavior to the fluid. This complex behavior results in a non-linear relationship between stress and deformation standing in between Newton’s law of viscosity for an ideal viscous liquid and Hooke’s law for an ideal elastic material. Such non-linear viscoelastic behavior breaks down flow reversibility under creeping flow conditions, as encountered at the micro-scale, and can lead to flow instabilities. These instabilities offer an alternative to the development of systems requiring unstable flows under conditions where chaotic advection is unfeasible. Flows of viscoelastic fluids are characterized by the Weissenberg (Wi) and Reynolds (Re) numbers, and at the micro-scale flow instabilities occur in regions in the Wi–Re space typically unreachable at the macro-scale, namely high Wi and low Re. In this paper, we review recent experimental work by the authors on the topic of elastic instabilities in flows having a strong extensional component, including: flow through a hyperbolic contraction followed by a sudden expansion; flow in a microfluidic diode and in a flow focusing device; flow around a confined cylinder; flow through porous media and simplified porous media analogs. These flows exhibit different types of flow transitions depending on geometry, Wi and Re, including: transition from a steady symmetric to a steady asymmetric flow, often followed by a second transition to unsteady flow at high Wi; direct transition between steady symmetric and unsteady flows.",B & E,547

Sphingosine kinases play a fundamental role in many signaling pathways associated with cancer, suggesting that proteins belonging to this signaling network represent potential therapeutic targets. Over the last years, many improvements have been made in the treatment of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL); however, novel and less toxic therapies are still needed, especially for relapsing and chemo-resistant patients. Here, we analyzed the therapeutic potential of SKi and ROMe, a sphingosine kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor and SK2-selective inhibitor, respectively. While SKi induced apoptosis, ROMe initiated an autophagic cell death in our in vitro cell models. SKi treatment induced an increase in SK1 protein levels in Molt-4 cells, whereas it activated the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway in Jurkat and CEM-R cells as protective mechanisms in a sub-population of T-ALL cells. Interestingly, we observed a synergistic effect of SKi with the classical chemotherapeutic drug vincristine. In addition, we reported that SKi affected signaling cascades implicated in survival, proliferation and stress response of cells. These findings indicate that SK1 or SK2 represent potential targets for treating T-ALL.",F & K,735

Using wavelength dispersive x-ray microanalysis and Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy it is found that the N-rich samples (Ga flux < 2.3 × 10−7 Torr) incorporate a higher magnitude of GaSb than the Ga-rich samples (Ga flux > 2.3 × 10−7 Torr) under the same growth conditions. The optical properties of the Ga-rich samples are measured using room temperature cathodoluminescence (CL), photoluminescence (PL) and absorption measurements. A broad luminescence peak is observed around 2.2 eV. The nature and properties of this peak are considered, as is the suitability of these dilute-Sb alloys for use in solar energy conversion devices.",M & I,126

To identify anticonvulsant secondary metabolites, we performed an in vivo, zebrafish-based screen of medicinal plants used in Southeast Asia for the treatment of seizures. Solanum torvum Sw. (Solanaceae) was identified as having significant anticonvulsant activity in zebrafish larvae with seizures induced by the GABAA antagonist pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). This finding correlates well with the ethnomedical use of this plant in the Philippines, where a water decoction of S. torvum leaves is used to treat epileptic seizures. HPLC microfractionation of the bioactive crude extract, in combination with the in vivo zebrafish seizure assay, enabled the rapid localization of several bioactive compounds that were partially identified on-line by UHPLC-TOF-MS as steroid glycosides. Targeted isolation of the active constituents from the methanolic extract enabled the complete de novo structure identification of the six main bioactive compounds that were also present in the traditional preparation. To partially mimic the in vivo metabolism of these triterpene glycosides, their common aglycone was generated by acid hydrolysis. The isolated molecules exhibited significant anticonvulsant activity in zebrafish seizure assays. These results underscore the potential of zebrafish bioassay-guided microfractionation to rapidly identify novel bioactive small molecules of natural origin.",B & L,196
C,Optimisation of a lithium magnesiate for use in the non-cryogenic asymmetric deprotonation of prochiral ketones,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimisation-of-a-lithium-magnesiate-for-use-in-the-non-cryogenic,"A study has been conducted to determine whether lithium magnesiates are feasible candidates for the enantioselective deprotonation of 4-alkylcyclohexanones. The commercially available chiral amine (+)-bis[(R)-1-phenylethyl]amine (2-H) was utilised to induce enantioselection. When transformed to its lithium salt and combined with nBu 2Mg, improved enantioselective deprotonation of 4-tert- butylcyclohexanone (with respect to the monometallic lithium amide) at 20°C was observed. In an attempt to optimise the reaction further, different additives were added to the lithium amide. The best performing deprotonations at 0°C were those in which (Me3SiCH2)2Mg (er pro-S 74:26) and (Me3SiCH2)2Mn (er pro-S 72:28) were added, hence the lithium magnesiate ""LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe 3)2"" was used in the remainder of the study. The optimum solvent for the reaction was found to be THF. NMR spectroscopic studies of a D8-THF solution of ""LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe 3)2"" appear to show that this mono-amide bis-alkyl species is in equilibrium with a bis-amide mono-alkyl compound (and a tris-alkyl lithium magnesiate). When a genuine bis-amide lithium magnesiate solution is used, the deprotonation results were essentially identical to those obtained for ""LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe3)2"". By adding LiCl to ""LiMg(2)(CH2SiMe3)2"" the er at 0°C improved to 81:19. At -78°C good yields and an er of 93:7 were obtained. This LiCl-containing base was used to successfully deprotonate other 4-alkylcyclohexanones.",E & A,341
A,Associations of HLA alleles with specific language impairment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/associations-of-hla-alleles-with-specific-language-impairment,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci have been implicated in several neurodevelopmental disorders in which language is affected. However, to date, no studies have investigated the possible involvement of HLA loci in specific language impairment (SLI), a disorder that is defined primarily upon unexpected language impairment. We report association analyses of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and HLA types in a cohort of individuals affected by language impairment.  We perform quantitative association analyses of three linguistic measures and case-control association analyses using both SNP data and imputed HLA types.  Quantitative association analyses of imputed HLA types suggested a role for the HLA-A locus in susceptibility to SLI. HLA-A A1 was associated with a measure of short-term memory (P = 0.004) and A3 with expressive language ability (P = 0.006). Parent-of-origin effects were found between HLA-B B8 and HLA-DQA1*0501 and receptive language. These alleles have a negative correlation with receptive language ability when inherited from the mother (P = 0.021, P = 0.034, respectively) but are positively correlated with the same trait when paternally inherited (P = 0.013, P = 0.029, respectively). Finally, case control analyses using imputed HLA types indicated that the DR10 allele of HLA-DRB1 was more frequent in individuals with SLI than population controls (P = 0.004, relative risk = 2.575), as has been reported for individuals with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  These preliminary data provide an intriguing link to those described by previous studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders and suggest a possible role for HLA loci in language disorders.",A & G,895
D,Azimuthal asymmetry in collective electron dynamics in relativistically transparent laser-foil interactions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/azimuthal-asymmetry-in-collective-electron-dynamics-in-relativist,"Asymmetry in the collective dynamics of ponderomotively-driven electrons in the interaction of an ultraintense laser pulse with a relativistically transparent target is demonstrated experimentally. The 2D prole of the beam of accelerated electrons is shown to change from an ellipse aligned along the laser polarisation direction in the case of limited transparency, to a double-lobe structure aligned perpendicular to it when a significant fraction of the laser pulse co-propagates with the electrons. The temporally-resolved dynamics of the interaction are investigated via particle-in-cell simulations. The results provide new insight into the collective response of charged particles to intense laser fields over an extended interaction volume, which is important for a wide range of applications, and in particular for the development of promising new ultraintense laser-driven ion acceleration mechanisms involving ultrathin target foils.",H & L,313

The critical submicronstripe metallic electrodes, which define the emission pattern, are formed by direct LED writing in a mask-free manner. The individually addressable submicron-stripe LEDs show excellent performance in terms of their electrical characteristics (with typical turn-on voltage of 3 V, operational stability and power output up to 28 μW at 3 mA). Unlike conventional broad-sized LEDs, the efficiency droop of the submicron-stripe LED is significantly suppressed-in fact, there is no efficiency droop for current densities up to 100 A/cm2. Furthermore, the submicron-stripe LED shows a lower temperature-dependent shift of the emission wavelength. The lateral emission width is increased with increasing injection current, resulting in a wider lateral emission size than the metallic submicron-stripe electrode. The underlying physics of these phenomena are analysed. Such submicron-stripe LED arrays open up promising applications in nanophotonics and bio-sensing.",D,608

E,"ESCRT function in cytokinesis: location, dynamics and regulation by mitotic kinases",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/escrt-function-in-cytokinesis-location-dynamics-and-regulation-by,"Mammalian cytokinesis proceeds by constriction of an actomyosin ring and furrow ingression, resulting in the formation of the midbody bridge connecting two daughter cells. At the centre of the midbody resides the Flemming body, a dense proteinaceous ring surrounding the interlocking ends of anti-parallel microtubule arrays. Abscission, the terminal step of cytokinesis, occurs near the Flemming body. A series of broad processes govern abscission: the initiation and stabilisation of the abscission zone, followed by microtubule severing and membrane scission—The latter mediated by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins. A key goal of cell and developmental biologists is to develop a clear understanding of the mechanisms that underpin abscission, and how the spatiotemporal coordination of these events with previous stages in cell division is accomplished. This article will focus on the function and dynamics of the ESCRT proteins in abscission and will review recent work, which has begun to explore how these complex protein assemblies are regulated by the cell cycle machinery.",B & E,830
D,A widely linear multichannel Wiener filter for wind prediction,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-widely-linear-multichannel-wiener-filter-for-wind-prediction,"The desire to improve short-term predictions of wind speed and direction has motivated the development of a spatial covariance-based predictor in a complex valued multichannel structure. Wind speed and direction are modelled as the magnitude and phase of complex time series and measurements from multiple geographic locations are embedded in a complex vector which is then used as input to a multichannel Wiener prediction filter. Building on a C-linear cyclo-stationary predictor, a new widely linear filter is developed and tested on hourly mean wind speed and direction measurements made at 13 locations in the UK over 6 years. The new predictor shows a reduction in mean squared error at all locations. Furthermore it is found that the scale of that reduction strongly depends on conditions local to the measurement site.",E & F,385
B,A generic evaluation of loads in horizontal axis wind turbines,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-generic-evaluation-of-loads-in-horizontal-axis-wind-turbines,"This paper forms part of a PhD research programme aiming to search for systematic trends in loads as influenced by: wind conditions (mean wind speed, turbulence intensity), design properties of wind turbines (mass, stiffness and turbine scale) and key design parameters (design tip speed ratio, for example). Within the scope of this paper an investigation is made of how blade mass and stiffness affect trends in lifetime damage equivalent loads (DEL) of the rotor blade root fatigue loading (as may influence hub design). Clearest results emerge where the mass and stiffness are changed proportionally so as to maintain the natural frequency. This is perhaps because any substantial changes in the design parameters of a wind turbine are likely to demand a retune or re-design of the control system. A preliminary study of the influence of wind turbine scale was also considered based on scaling with similarity.",F & K,647

The AHKC Report Card process was replicated in 14 additional countries from 5 continents using 9 common indicators (Overall Physical Activity, Organized Sport Participation, Active Play, Active Transportation, Sedentary Behavior, Family and Peers, School, Community and Built Environment, and Government Strategies and Investments), a harmonized process and a standardized grading framework. The 15 Report Cards were presented at the Global Summit on the Physical Activity of Children in Toronto on May 20, 2014. The consolidated findings are summarized here in the form of a global matrix of grades. There is a large spread in grades across countries for most indicators. Countries that lead in certain indicators lag in others. Overall, the grades for indicators of physical activity (PA) around the world are low/poor. Many countries have insufficient information to assign a grade, particularly for the Active Play and Family and Peers indicators. Grades for Sedentary Behaviors are, in general, better in low income countries. The Community and Built Environment indicator received high grades in high income countries and notably lower grades in low income countries. There was a pattern of higher PA and lower sedentary behavior in countries reporting poorer infrastructure, and lower PA and higher sedentary behavior in countries reporting better infrastructure, which presents an interesting paradox. Many surveillance and research
gaps and weaknesses were apparent. International cooperation and cross-fertilization is encouraged to tackle existing challenges, understand underlying mechanisms, derive innovative solutions, and overcome the expanding childhood inactivity crisis.",M & I,302

Water governance is defined here as a process in which law has a transformational role by allowing policy goals to become tangible and enforceable rights and obligations. Against this conceptual background global water governance appears to be still fragmented and incoherent. More coordination efforts and further harmonisation is needed, but more importantly global institutions are required to allow international law to operate effectively. It is within this context that the UNCSD can be seen as an international agenda setting process and three key water related topics appear to be on such agenda: water and sanitation; water and ecosystem services and water and climate change. The paper concludes with a call in favor of considering water not just as a public good, but mainly as a driver for sustainable development.",E & A,679

Mass spectrometry-based approaches are commonly used to analyze protein phosphorylation, but such analysis is challenging, largely due to the low phosphorylation stoichiometry. Hence, a number of phosphopeptide enrichment strategies have been developed, including metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). Here, we describe a new material for performing MOAC that employs a magnetite-doped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), that is suitable for the creation of microwell array and microfluidic systems to enable low volume, high throughput analysis. Incubation time and sample loading were explored and optimized and demonstrate that the embedded magnetite is able to enrich phosphopeptides.

A,Diffusion of e-health innovations in 'post-conflict' settings: a qualitative study on the personal experiences of health workers,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/diffusion-of-e-health-innovations-in-post-conflict-settings-a-qua,"Background: Technological innovations have the potential to strengthen human resources for health and improve access and quality of care in challenging 'post-conflict' contexts. However, analyses on the adoption of technology for health (that is, 'e-health') and whether and how e-health can strengthen a health workforce in these settings have been limited so far. This study explores the personal experiences of health workers using e-health innovations in selected post-conflict situations. Methods: This study had a cross-sectional qualitative design. Telephone interviews were conducted with 12 health workers, from a variety of cadres and stages in their careers, from four post-conflict settings (Liberia, West Bank and Gaza, Sierra Leone and Somaliland) in 2012. Everett Roger's diffusion of innovation-decision model (that is, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, contemplation) guided the thematic analysis.Results: All health workers interviewed held positive perceptions of e-health, related to their beliefs that e-health can help them to access information and communicate with other health workers. However, understanding of the scope of e-health was generally limited, and often based on innovations that health workers have been introduced through by their international partners. Health workers reported a range of engagement with e-health innovations, mostly for communication (for example, email) and educational purposes (for example, online learning platforms). Poor, unreliable and unaffordable Internet was a commonly mentioned barrier to e-health use. Scaling-up existing e-health partnerships and innovations were suggested starting points to increase e-health innovation dissemination. Conclusions: Results from this study showed ICT based e-health innovations can relieve information and communication needs of health workers in post-conflict settings. However, more efforts and investments, preferably driven by healthcare workers within the post-conflict context, are needed to make e-health more widespread and sustainable. Increased awareness is necessary among health professionals, even among current e-health users, and physical and financial access barriers need to be addressed. Future e-health initiatives are likely to increase their impact if based on perceived health information needs of intended users.",C,992

Instead, equilibrium unemployment is haunted by hysteresis. The curious history of the natural rate hypothesis is considered, curious because the authors of the hypothesis thought hysteresis to be relevant. The various methods that have been used to model hysteresis in economic systems are outlined, including the Preisach model with its selective, erasable memory properties. The evidence regarding hysteresis effects on output and unemployment is then reviewed. The implications for macroeconomic policy, and for the macroeconomics profession, are discussed.",E & F,165
B,Initiatives to improve prescribing efficiency in China and their influence: cardio-cerebral vascular medicines as a case history to provide future direction,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/initiatives-to-improve-prescribing-efficiency-in-china-and-their-,"Background: Pharmaceutical expenditure has grown by 16% per annum in China during the past decade. This has been enhanced by increased coverage as well as incentives to physicians and hospitals. Hospital pharmacies dispense 80% of medicines in China, with medicines currently accounting for 46% of total hospital expenditure. Hospitals currently rely on revenues from procurement of medicines for their sustainability. Principal measures to moderate growth in drug expenditure include initiatives to reduce procured drug prices. However, to date no formal pricing policies for generics in China similar to Europe and limited demand-side measures to enhance appropriate prescribing, e.g. no universal measures to monitor the quality of prescribing. Current incentives have led to irrationality in prescribing; e.g. high use of injectable drugs, antibiotics and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) despite the development of essential medicine lists. Objective: Assess current utilisation and expenditure of CV medicines including TCMs between 2006 and 2012 and compare the findings with Western European countries. Methods: Uncontrolled retrospective study of prescriptions to treat cardio-vascular disease in one of the largest hospitals in Southwest China. Results: Utilisation of CV drugs increased 3.3 fold during the study period, greatest for TCMs. Procured expenditure increased 4.85 fold. Variable utilisation of generics at 29% to 31% of the total for each molecule in recent years among high volume pharmacotherapeutic products.  However, low prices for generics have been achieved through multiple supply-side measures, matching those achieved among some European countries. Continued irrationality in prescribing is seen with high use TCMs despite limited evidence and the utilisation of drugs dropping significantly once low prices procured. Conclusion: Prices still have appreciable impact on the subsequent utilization of different CV drugs in China. Consequently, there is appreciable potential to introduce measures similar to Western Europe to improve future rationality and reduce overall drug costs.

We are beginning to see improved rationality in the use of medicines with a reduction in TCMs. This will be monitored along with other suggestions to further enhance accessibility to medicines in China without prohibitive increases in pharmaceutical and overall expenditure.",F & K,550
B,Effects of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport in relativistic laser-solid interactions,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/effects-of-electrical-resistivity-on-fast-electron-transport-in-r,"This thesis reports on experimental and numerical investigations of relativistic electron transport in solids irradiated by intense (i.e. IL > 10p19s Wcmp-2s) laser pulses. Specifically, the effect of electrical resistivity on fast electron transport is explored. The first investigation explores fast electron transport in allotropes of carbon by measuring the spatial-intensity distribution of the beam of protons accelerated from the target rear-surface. An analytical model is developed which accounts for the rear-surface fast electron sheath dynamics, ionisation and projection of the resulting beam of protons, and is used (in conjunction with the experimental measurements) to infer annular fast electron beam transport with lamentary structure in 200 um-thick diamond targets. The important role that material lattice structure has in defining electrical resistivity, which in turn defines the fast electron transport properties, is established utilising three-dimensional hybrid pa rticle-in-cell (3D hybrid-PIC) simulations together with an analytical model of the resistive lamentation instability. The second investigation explores fast electron transport in silicon utilising both experimental measurements and 3D hybrid-PIC simulations. Annular fast electron transport is demonstrated and explained by resistively generated magnetic fields. The results indicate the potential to completely transform the beam transport pattern by tailoring the resistivity-temperature profile at temperatures as low as a few eV. Additionally, the sensitivity of annular fast electron beam transport is explored by varying the drive laser pulse parameters (i.e. energy, focal spot radius and pulse duration) and is found to be particularly sensitive to the peak laser pulse intensity. An ability to optically 'tune' the properties of an annular fast electron transport pattern may be important for applications. In the final investigation the effect that initial target temperature, and thus lattice melt, has on fast electron transport properties is demonstrated. Laser-accelerated proton beams are used to isochorically heat silicon for several tens-of-picoseconds prior to the propagation of fast electrons through the pre-heated target. This enables the influence of resistivity gradients, generated by proton-induced lattice melt, on fast electron transport properties to be explored. The experimental observation of an annular proton beam after t heat = 30 ps of proton pre-heating, which corresponds to annular electron transport within the target, is in excellent qualitative agreement with 3-D hybrid-PIC simulations of fast electron transport in a target containing an initial temperature (and thus, resistivity) gradient.",M & I,746
D,Change or control? Developing dialogues between research and public protection,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/change-or-control-developing-dialogues-between-research-and-publi,"This paper aims to scope out some of the implications of desistance research for the community management of high risk offenders. Acknowledging the limited empirical research exploring this interface, this paper outlines the evolving evidence base and what this tells us about the process of desistance and what supports it. The evidence as to whether 'high risk offenders' desist and what we know about this process is discussed prior to outlining the landscape of current and principal practice approaches which can be located in the community/public protection model. Potential dialogues between desistance research and public protection practices are discussed to explore ensuing implications and opportunities for practice.",B & L,768
C,Transporting functions across ornaments,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/transporting-functions-across-ornaments-2,"Programming with dependent types is a blessing and a curse. It is a blessing to be able to bake invariants into the definition of datatypes: We can finally write correct-by-construction software. However, this extreme accuracy is also a curse: A datatype is the combination of a structuring medium together with a special purpose logic. These domain-specific logics hamper any attempt to reuse code across similarly structured data. In this paper, we capitalise on the structural invariants of datatypes. To do so, we first adapt the notion of ornament to our universe of inductive families. We then show how code reuse can be achieved by ornamenting functions. Using these functional ornaments, we capture the relationship between functions such as the addition of natural numbers and the concatenation of lists. With this knowledge, we demonstrate how the implementation of the former informs the implementation of the latter: The users can ask the definition of addition to be lifted to lists and they will only be asked the details necessary to carry on adding lists rather than numbers. Our presentation is formalised in the type theory with a universe of datatypes and all our constructions have been implemented as generic programs, requiring no extension to the type theory.",E & A,126
A,Qualitative SERS analysis of G-quadruplex DNAs using selective stabilising ligands,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/qualitative-sers-analysis-of-g-quadruplex-dnas-using-selective-st,"Nucleic acids are of key biological importance due to their range of functions and ability to form various different structures, with an example of emerging significance being quadruplexes formed by guanine-rich sequences. These guanine rich sequences are found in different regions of the genome such as telomeres, gene promoters and introns and UTRs of mRNAs. Here a new approach has been developed that utilises surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of the formation of G-quadruplexes. Three G-quadruplex stabilising ligands that each have their own unique SERS response were used in this study and their ability to act as reporters assessed. A SERS response was only obtained from the ligands in the absence of G-quadruplex formation. This resulted in an ""on/off"" method which was successfully used to qualitatively detect the formation of G-quadruplex using quadruplex-forming sequences such as human telomeric and C-MYC promoter DNAs. The unique SERS spectra of each stabilising ligand offer the potential for use of SERS to study higher order DNA structures. This work shows that the ligands used can act simultaneously as a potential therapeutic stabilising agent and a SERS reporter, therefore allowing the use of SERS as a method of analysis of the formation of G-quadruplex DNAs.",A & G,749

In particular, we find that the radiation, generated by a down-going electron horseshoe distribution is due to a backward-wave cyclotron-maser emission process. The backward wave nature of the radiation contributes to upward refraction of the radiation that is also enhanced by a density inhomogeneity. We also show that the radiation is preferentially amplified along the auroral oval rather than transversely. The results are in agreement with recent Cluster observations.",H & L,733

The simplified case of a two-dimensional (2D) problem was considered. The governing equations were derived, and the hydrodynamic forces were calculated and the effect of motion in these forces was taken into consideration. The final equations were linearised and an eigenvalue analysis was employed to systematically examine the stability with the emphasis on identifying the critical current speed for a given system. This model was validated against the available test results and showed a good agreement. A parametric study was also carried out. It showed the significant role of the hydrodynamic coefficients as well as mass distribution in the stability of the system.",D,898
C,Malaria protein kinase CK2 (PfCK2) shows novel mechanisms of regulation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/malaria-protein-kinase-ck2-pfck2-shows-novel-mechanisms-of-regula,"Casein kinase 2 (protein kinase CK2) is a conserved eukaryotic serine/theronine kinase with multiple substrates and roles in the regulation of cellular processes such as cellular stress, cell proliferation and apoptosis. Here we report a detailed analysis of the Plasmodium falciparum CK2, PfCK2, demonstrating that this kinase, like the mammalian orthologue, is a dual specificity kinase able to phosphorylate at both serine and tyrosine. However, unlike the human orthologue that is auto-phosphorylated on tyrosine within the activation loop, PfCK2 shows no activation loop auto-phosphorylation but rather is auto-phosphorylated at threonine 63 within subdomain I. Phosphorylation at this site in PfCK2 is shown here to regulate the intrinsic kinase activity of PfCK2. Furthermore, we generate an homology model of PfCK2 in complex with the known selective protein kinase CK2 inhibitor, quinalizarin, and in so doing identify key co-ordinating residues in the ATP binding pocket that could aid in designing selective inhibitors to PfCK2.",C,932
E,First-guess generation of solar sail interplanetary heteroclinic connections,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/first-guess-generation-of-solar-sail-interplanetary-heteroclinic-,"This work deals with the generation of first-guess interplanetary trajectories
connecting Libration Point Orbits (LPOs) belonging to different restricted three body problems. With the Sun always as first primary, the Earth, Mars and Mercury are assumed as second primary, and their relative models are coupled together with the view of defining heteroclinic connections. On suitable Poincaré sections, solar sail sets are constructed to obtain transit conditions from LPOs of the departure dynamical system to LPOs of the arrival one. Constant attitude solar sails are investigated, assuming spacecraft with limited control capabilities. The preliminary propellant-free transfer trajectories are considered for a range of novel solar sail applications, including a continuous Earth–Mars communication link, an Earth–Mars cargo transport gateway and an opportunity for in-situ observations of Mercury.",B & E,890
D,S.A.S v France: supporting 'living together' or forced assimilation?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/sas-v-france-supporting-living-together-or-forced-assimilation,"The Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights has upheld the French law which prohibits the concealment of one’s face in public places. The law is directed principally at prohibiting Muslim women covering their faces in public spaces in France. The decision of the Strasbourg Court is premised on the French notion of ‘le vivre ensemble’; ‘living together.’ This critical analysis of the judgment contends that the decision is flawed and retrogressive for women’s rights in particular and undermines the socio-cultural rights and freedoms of individuals who belong to minority groups in general. On wider implications of the decision, it is worrisome that the decision appears to pander to dangerous political leanings currently growing in many parts of Europe and beyond. The Court risks promoting forced assimilation policies against minorities in various parts of the world. To illustrate its implications, the article highlights the experience of the Uyghurs, a Turkic ethnic group in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China.",E & F,772
B,"DataSHIELD: taking the analysis to the data, not the data to the analysis",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/datashield-taking-the-analysis-to-the-data-not-the-data-to-the-an,"Research in modern biomedicine and social science requires sample sizes so large that they can often only be achieved through a pooled co-analysis of data from several studies. But the pooling of information from individuals in a central database that may be queried by researchers raises important ethico-legal questions and can be controversial. In the UK this has been highlighted by recent debate and controversy relating to the UK's proposed 'care.data' initiative, and these issues reflect important societal and professional concerns about privacy, confidentiality and intellectual property. DataSHIELD provides a novel technological solution that can circumvent some of the most basic challenges in facilitating the access of researchers and other healthcare professionals to individual-level data. Commands are sent from a central analysis computer (AC) to several data computers (DCs) storing the data to be co-analysed. The data sets are analysed simultaneously but in parallel. The separate parallelized analyses are linked by non-disclosive summary statistics and commands transmitted back and forth between the DCs and the AC. This paper describes the technical implementation of DataSHIELD using a modified R statistical environment linked to an Opal database deployed behind the computer firewall of each DC. Analysis is controlled through a standard R environment at the AC. Based on this Opal/R implementation, DataSHIELD is currently used by the Healthy Obese Project and the Environmental Core Project (BioSHaRE-EU) for the federated analysis of 10 data sets across eight European countries, and this illustrates the opportunities and challenges presented by the DataSHIELD approach. DataSHIELD facilitates important research in settings where: (i) a co-analysis of individual-level data from several studies is scientifically necessary but governance restrictions prohibit the release or sharing of some of the required data, and/or render data access unacceptably slow; (ii) a research group (e.g. in a developing nation) is particularly vulnerable to loss of intellectual property-the researchers want to fully share the information held in their data with national and international collaborators, but do not wish to hand over the physical data themselves; and (iii) a data set is to be included in an individual-level co-analysis but the physical size of the data precludes direct transfer to a new site for analysis.",F & K,897
C,An exponentially fast attitude tracking controller on the rotation group,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-exponentially-fast-attitude-tracking-controller-on-the-rotatio,"In this paper a continuous attitude tracking control law is derived directly on the rotation group SO(3). The proposed control law is shown to reduce the closed-loop attitude dynamics to a linear oscillator description of the eigen-axis error, without the need for a small angle approximation. The main practical benefit of this is that the gains can be easily tuned to drive this eigen-axis error to zero exponentially fast and with a damped response without oscillations. The approach uses geodesic error metrics on the rotation group and the angular velocity to construct a Lyapunov function. The time-derivative of this Lyapunov function is control dependent and a continuous control is selected to guarantee asymptotic tracking of the reference motion. Furthermore, the closed-loop system, with this rotation-matrix based feedback control applied, is converted to its quaternion form and further reduced to an eigen-axis error description of the dynamics. This reduction reveals a simple method for tuning the control which involves only one parameter which can be selected to obtain the fastest convergence to the reference motion. However, this control suffers the problem related to the exponential coordinates; the control is not defined globally. This paper shows that by converting the control to quaternions and augmenting the control a globally defined exponentially fast tracking control law can be defined. The proposed control is applied in simulation to the attitude control of a small spacecraft and shows a settling time performance enhancement, for given actuator constraints, compared to a conventional quaternion tracking controller.",M & I,943

Among 25,397 Afrobarometer respondents in 18 countries, 26% report paying a bribe, while 74% do not. Five hypotheses offer explanations: institutional context, inequalities of socio-economic resources, social inclusion and exclusion, social and political capital, and conflicting norms. Multilevel statistical analysis identifies as most important: contextual differences in colonial legacies, ethnic politicization, service provision, press freedom, and having social or political capital. The analysis emphasizes studying behavior rather than perceptions of corruption and supports a public-policy focus on bribery as an exchange for specific public services.",B & L,179
A,An overview of marine corrosion protection with a focus on cathodic protection and coatings,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-overview-of-marine-corrosion-protection-with-a-focus-on-cathod,"Corrosion is the gradual deterioration of a material or its properties through a chemical reaction with its environment. There are several methods of preventing a material from corroding. Cathodic protection (CP) and coatings are very popular methods for corrosion protection. Each individual method has its own benefits and drawbacks, whereas experience has shown that the most effective method of corrosion prevention is a combination of both CP and coatings. This combination can provide very good protection over a long period of time.  This paper focuses on the combined use of both CP and coatings for ships. Calculation of a CP design is explained briefly and the factors affecting the choice of the type of CP system are demonstrated. Then, a sample anode plan of a ship is shown. Finally, the 
calculation of a cathodic protection system of a ship is presented using data provided by coating manufacturers and shipyards.",E & A,879

C,Introduction and sustained high coverage of the HPV bivalent vaccine leads to a reduction in prevalence of HPV 16/18 and closely related HPV types,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/introduction-and-sustained-high-coverage-of-the-hpv-bivalent-vacc,"In 2008, a national human papillomavirus (HPV) immunisation programme began in Scotland for 12–13 year old females with a three-year catch-up campaign for those under the age of 18. Since 2008, three-dose uptake of bivalent vaccine in the routine cohort aged 12–13 has exceeded 90% annually, while in the catch-up cohort overall uptake is 66%.  To monitor the impact of HPV immunisation, a programme of national surveillance was established (pre and post introduction) which included yearly sampling and HPV genotyping of women attending for cervical screening at age 20. By linking individual vaccination, screening and HPV testing records, we aim to determine the impact of the immunisation programme on circulating type-specific HPV infection particularly for four outcomes: (i) the vaccine types HPV 16 or 18 (ii) types considered to be associated with cross-protection: HPV 31, 33 or 45; (iii) all other high-risk types and (iv) any HPV.  From a total of 4679 samples tested, we demonstrate that three doses (n=1100) of bivalent vaccine are associated with a significant reduction in prevalence of HPV 16 and 18 from 29.8% (95% confidence interval 28.3, 31.3%) to 13.6% (95% confidence interval 11.7, 15.8%). The data also suggest cross-protection against HPV 31, 33 and 45. HPV 51 and 56 emerged as the most prevalent (10.5% and 9.6%, respectively) non-vaccine high-risk types in those vaccinated, but at lower rates than HPV 16 (25.9%) in those unvaccinated.  This data demonstrate the positive impact of bivalent vaccination on the prevalence of HPV 16, 18, 31, 33 and 45 in the target population and is encouraging for countries which have achieved high-vaccine uptake.",H & L,772

In the limit where the cavity-field dynamics is adiabatically eliminated, the interaction between the condensate and the cavity displays a range of nonlinear dynamical behaviors such as multistability, quasiperiodicity, and conservative chaotic oscillations. We show that chaotic oscillations are ubiquitous when repulsive atom-atom interactions are included in the model. Despite the complexity of the full coupled BEC-cavity system, the essential features of its nonlinear and chaotic behavior are low-dimensional and are well described by considering the evolution of only a few motional states of the BEC.",B & E,926

B,The Effects of Financial Development on Foreign Direct Investment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-effects-of-financial-development-on-foreign-direct-investment,"This paper examines how financial development influences foreign direct investment. The direct and indirect sector-specific effects that source countries' financial development and destination countries' financial development can have on foreign direct investment are first identified in a conceptual framework. The presence and relative strength of these various channels of influence at the different margins of foreign direct investment are then empirically investigated using unique and underexploited sector-specific bilateral panel data on greenfield foreign direct investment over the period 2003-2006. Causality is established by applying a difference-in-differences approach that exploits the variation in financial vulnerability across manufacturing sectors. The overall effects of higher source countries' financial development and destination countries' financial development on the relative volume of bilateral foreign direct investment in financially vulnerable sectors are large, positive, and complementary. These effects appear to operate mainly at the intensive margin rather than at the extensive margin of foreign direct investment. There is also evidence of direct and indirect effects of financial development. The key findings are robust to the use of data on the number of bilateral Mergers\&Acquisitions transactions. Overall, the empirical results unambiguously indicate that a sophisticated and well-functioning financial system in source and destination countries greatly facilitates the international expansion of firms through foreign direct investment, especially in financially vulnerable sectors.",E & F & G,784
C,Collective thinking about the future? A study of three citizens’ juries on wind farms in Scotland,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/collective-thinking-about-the-future-a-study-of-three-citizens-ju,"Mini-publics are the most lauded device for institutionalising deliberative democracy, and citizens’ juries have been the most used type. They are seen as an opportunity for citizens to deliberate on important and contentious issues, and to revise their preferences in light of deliberation. This paper analyses three Citizens’ juries conducted in different locations in Scotland on the contested topic of onshore wind farms. The locations were selected according to proximity to windfarms, and the three juries were held successively from September 2013 to February 2014. Although part of a research project, the citizens’ juries were nonetheless designed to inform Scottish policy debate about both wind farm development and public involvement in decision making on this topic. Over two days, the jurors addressed, together, the following question: ‘What should be the key principles for deciding about wind farm development, and why?’ Accordingly, the jurors were invited to engage with long-term considerations regarding policy, energy generation and climate change. Using findings from mixed methods research, this paper reflects on the extent to which the citizens’ juries were ‘thinking about the future’, and the potential of democratic innovations to counter short-term thinking in policy and decision-making.",H,508

Many of these programs have been subjected to numerous validation studies which have demonstrated their capability of representing reality adequately if the correct inputs are available. However, that is rarely the case and often many input variables are unknown or subject to high uncertainty making predictions quite different from reality.

E,Operability assessment of high speed passenger ships based on human comfort criteria,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/operability-assessment-of-high-speed-passenger-ships-based-on-hum,"The growing popularity of passenger cruise lines means continual challenges are faced concerning both a vessel׳s design and its operational ability. Vessel dimensions, service speeds and performance rates are rapidly increasing to keep pace with this expanding interest. It is essential that vessels demonstrate high performances, even in adverse sea and weather conditions, and ensure the comfort of passengers and the safety of cargo. A vessel׳s operability can be defined as the percentage of time in which the vessel is capable of performing her tasks securely. In order to calculate a vessel׳s operability index, many key parameters are required. These include the dynamic responses of the ship to regular waves, the wave climate of the sea around the ship׳s route, and the assigned missions of the vessel. This paper presents a procedure to calculate the operability index of a ship using seakeeping analyses. A discussion of the sensitivity of the results relative to three different employed seakeeping methods is then given. The effect of seasonality on a ship׳s estimated operability is also investigated using wave scatter diagrams. Finally, a high speed catamaran ferry is explored as a case study and its operability is assessed with regards to human comfort criteria.",K & L & M,627

In addition, the flow forces on the disc and the lift are monitored and analyzed and the comparison of the effects of design parameters, are examined; including the adjusting ring position, vessel volume and spring stiffness. Results from the model allow the fluid and
dynamic characteristics of the SRV to be investigated and shows that the model has great potential of assisting engineers in the preliminary design of SRVs, operating under actual conditions which are often found to be difficult to interpret in practice.",B & C & D,103

The number of photons measured is up to 9 × 106 per shot for a 100 period undulator, with a mean peak brilliance of 1 × 1018 photons/s/mrad2/mm2/0.1% bandwidth. Simulations estimate that the driving electron bunch r.m.s. duration is as short as 3 fs when the electron beam has energy of 120–130 MeV with the radiation pulse duration in the range of 50–100 fs.",E & F,814

C,SINBAD - a proposal for a dedicated accelerator research facility at DESY,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/sinbad-a-proposal-for-a-dedicated-accelerator-research-facility-a,"A dedicated accelerator research and development facility SINBAD (Short INnovative Bunches and Accelerators at DESY) is proposed. This multi-purpose research facility is initially aimed at promoting three major goals: (1) Short electron bunches for ultra-fast science. (2) Construction of a plasma accelerator module with useable beam quality (3) Setup of an attosecond radiation source with advanced technology. Research and development on these topics is presently ongoing at various places at DESY, as add-on experiments at operational facilities. The two research goals are intimately connected: short bunches and precise femtosecond timing are requirements for developing a plasma accelerator module with external injection or staging. The scientific case of a dedicated facility for accelerator research at DESY is discussed. Further options are mentioned, like the use of a 1 GeV beam from Linac II for FEL studies. The presently planned conversion of the DORIS accelerator and its central halls into the SINBAD facility is described. The available space will allow setting up several independent experiments with a cost-effective use of the same infrastructure(for example a central high power laser, a central timing and synchronization lab, etc.). National and international contributions and proposals can be envisaged. A preliminary, possible layout and the design work plan are discussed.",L & K & C,564

We then study other possible descriptions of pi, first as the surface of the unit disk, second as the limit of perimeters of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides.In a third section, we concentrate on techniques to effectively compute approximations of pi in the proof assistant by relying on rational numbers and decimal representations.",A & D,723
E,Shrinking wings for ultrasonic pitch production: hyperintense ultra-short-wavelength calls in a new genus of neotropical katydids (Orthoptera: Tettigoniidae),https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/shrinking-wings-for-ultrasonic-pitch-production-hyperintense-ultr,"This article reports the discovery of a new genus and three species of predaceous katydid (Insecta: Orthoptera) from Colombia and Ecuador in which males produce the highest frequency ultrasonic calling songs so far recorded from an arthropod. Male katydids sing by rubbing their wings together to attract distant females. Their song frequencies usually range from audio (5 kHz) to low ultrasonic (30 kHz). However, males of Supersonus spp. call females at 115 kHz, 125 kHz, and 150 kHz. Exceeding the human hearing range (50 Hz–20 kHz) by an order of magnitude, these insects also emit their ultrasound at unusually elevated sound pressure levels (SPL). In all three species these calls exceed 110 dB SPL rms re 20 µPa (at 15 cm). Males of Supersonus spp. have unusually reduced forewings (<0.5 mm2). Only the right wing radiates appreciable sound, the left bears the file and does not show a particular resonance. In contrast to most katydids, males of Supersonus spp. position and move their wings during sound production so that the concave aspect of the right wing, underlain by the insect dorsum, forms a contained cavity with sharp resonance. The observed high SPL at extreme carrier frequencies can be explained by wing anatomy, a resonant cavity with a membrane, and cuticle deformation.",F & L & B,428
A,Fibronectin module FNIII9 adsorption at contrasting solid model surfaces studied by atomistic molecular dynamics,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/fibronectin-module-fnsupiiisup9-adsorption-at-contrasting-solid-m,"The mechanism of human fibronectin adhesion synergy region (known as integrin binding region) in repeat 9 (FNIII9) domain adsorption at pH 7 onto various and contrasting model surfaces has been studied using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. We use an ionic model to mimic mica surface charge density but without a long-range electric field above the surface, a silica model with a long-range electric field similar to that found experimentally, and an Au {111} model with no partial charges or electric field. A detailed description of the adsorption processes and the contrasts between the various model surfaces is provided. In the case of our model silica surface with a long-range electrostatic field, the adsorption is rapid and primarily driven by electrostatics. Because it is negatively charged (?1e), FN III9 readily adsorbs to a positively charged surface. However, due to its partial charge distribution, FNIII9 can also adsorb to the negatively charged mica model because of the absence of a long-range repulsive electric field. The protein dipole moment dictates its contrasting orientation at these surfaces, and the anchoring residues have opposite charges to the surface. Adsorption on the model Au {111} surface is possible, but less specific, and various protein regions might be involved in the interactions with the surface. Despite strongly influencing the protein mobility, adsorption at these model surfaces does not require wholesale FNIII9 conformational changes, which suggests that the biological activity of the adsorbed protein might be preserved.",E,449

A,Scotland’s international competitiveness within Western Europe,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/scotlands-international-competitiveness-within-western-europe,"The paper measures regional competitiveness of Scotland in comparison to ten EU regions and small countries using the International Benchmarking Index Family (‘IB Index Family’) developed by BAK Basel Economics.1 The IB Index Family contains an index with three dimensions of competitiveness: Performance, Attractiveness and Structural Potential. The Performance Index measures recent economic success; the Attractiveness Index measures how well a region is an attractive location to companies and highly-qualified individuals; and the Structural Potential Index estimates future potential economic growth based on current economic structure. The application of the IB Index Family provides a first-step into a more in-depth benchmarking of the competitiveness of a region, which is necessary when working towards detailed policy conclusions.

Patients with asthma who were naïve to previous long-acting β agonist therapy and initiated combination inhaler therapy in 2008–2009 were classified according to the inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) dose in their combination inhaler compared with the highest dose of ICS they received before initiation. Among the 685 patients (541 (79.0%) who had been prescribed an ICS previously), those originally on low-, medium- or high-dose ICS were changed to high-dose combination therapy in 122/250 (48.8%), 94/151 (62.3%) or 85/113 (75.2%) cases in each ICS dose category, respectively. These results suggest that evaluation of appropriate high-dose ICS prescribing in general practice is needed.",L,909
B,Lymphocyte-mediated neuroprotection in in vitro models of excitotoxicity involves astrocytic activation and the inhibition of MAP kinase signalling pathways,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/lymphocyte-mediated-neuroprotection-in-in-vitro-models-of-excitot,"It is well established that immunosurveillance is active in the CNS and plays a key role in several CNS disorders but the exact role of immune cells remains elusive. Thus, in the present study we investigated whether lymphocytes are protective/detrimental in in vitro models of excitotoxicty. Kainate (KA)-induced neuronal death was significantly reduced following exposure to mixed lymphocytes or purified T lymphocytes containing either activated or non-activated T-lymphocytes. Conditioned media from lymphocyte preparations, but not boiled conditioned media, was protective against KA-induced toxicity indicating soluble mediators underlie the observed neuroprotection with cytokine arrays indicating IL-16 as the likely candidate. A role for astrocytes was established as the neuroprotection was abolished in the presence of the glial toxin, fluoroacetate. Furthermore, lymphocytes inhibited p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways with pharmacological inhibition of these pathways mimicking the protective effect of lymphocytes. Similarly, lymphocytes were neuroprotective against oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced cell death with the inhibition of p38 MAPK and ERK signalling pathways involved. These data indicate that lymphocytes are neuroprotective under our experimental conditions and we suggest that astrocytic activation and inhibition of MAPK signalling cascades are involved but further studies are required to investigate whether similar mechanisms underlie the actions of lymphocytes in in vivo experimental models of disease.

Reservoirs are juxtaposed along the fault but shale-gouge ratio calculations indicate that the fault rock prohibits across-fault leakage of CO2.

Although the unprecedented urban growth of this city continues to be a subject of discussion, little attention has been given to investigate the new interventions and the resulting effects they have on the old center. This study aims to examine three important urban interventions, namely, the Museum of Islamic Art, the reconstruction of the traditional market called Souq Waqif, and the Msheireb urban regeneration project. It examines local and global issues, universal standard practices, and traditional knowledge. This study employs a descriptive analysis of these interventions to explore the impact of change in the old center, exemplified by socio-spatial and typo-morphological aspects. Reference is made to a number of empirical studies, including behavioral mapping, GIS population statistics, and analysis of historical maps. Results analytically narrate the reactions of these interventions to the possibility of simultaneously adopting universal practices with local knowledge, and whether prioritizing local influences would represent narrow-mindedness in shaping the city.",A & B & C & D,836
B,Longitudinal trajectories of peer relations in children with specific language impairment,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/longitudinal-trajectories-of-peer-relations-in-children-with-spec,"Background Peer relations is a vulnerable area of functioning in children with specific language impairment (SLI), but little is known about the developmental trajectories of individuals. Methods Peer problems were investigated over a 9-year period (from 7 to 16 years of age) in 171 children with a history of SLI. Discrete factor growth modelling was used to chart developmental trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate factors associated with group membership. Results Four distinct developmental trajectories were identified: low-level/no problems in peer relations (22.2% of participants), childhood-limited problems (12.3%), childhood-onset persistent problems (39.2%) and adolescent-onset problems (26.3%). Risk of poor trajectories of peer relations was greater for those children with pragmatic language difficulties. Prosocial behaviour was the factor most strongly associated with trajectory group membership. Overall, the more prosocial children with better pragmatic language skills and lower levels of emotional problems had less difficulty in developing peer relations. Conclusions Analysis of developmental trajectories enriches our understanding of social development. A sizeable minority in the present sample sustained positive relations through childhood and adolescence, and others overcame early difficulties to achieve low levels of problems by their early teens; the majority, however, showed childhood-onset persistent or adolescent-onset problems.",E & F & G,837
C,How radical is student engagement? (And what is it for?),https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/how-radical-is-student-engagement-and-what-is-it-for,"This paper argues that the term ‘student engagement’ as used in UK higher
education covers activities with two distinct sets of benefits: those that are
pedagogical, and those that are political. Without an overarching account of the
value of student engagement that can unify these two sets of benefits, the concept of student engagement in the UK is therefore fundamentally fractured. The paper proposes that critical pedagogy can provide that underpinning account, but at the expense of the current mainstream nature of student engagement. The paper therefore argues that those working in student engagement in UK higher education face a dilemma: either sacrifice the idea of student engagement as a popular solution to mainstream challenges, or give up the idea that student engagement has a unified set of benefits and coherent purpose.",H,266

E,New families of Sun-centred non-Keplerian orbits over cylinders and spheres,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/new-families-of-sun-centred-non-keplerian-orbits-over-cylinders-a,"This paper introduces new families of Sun-centered non-Keplerian orbits (NKOs) that are constrained to a three-dimensional, cylindrical or spherical surface. As such, they are an extension to the well-known families of displaced NKOs that are confined to a two-dimensional plane. The cylindrical and spherical orbits are found by investigating the geometrically constrained spacecraft dynamics. By imposing further constraints on the orbit's angular velocity and propulsive acceleration, the set of feasible orbits is defined. Additionally, the phase spaces of the orbits are explored and a numerical analysis is developed to find periodic orbits. The richness of the problem is further enhanced by considering both an inverse square acceleration law (mimicking solar electric propulsion) and a solar sail acceleration law to maintain the spacecraft on the three-dimensional surface. The wealth of orbits that these new families of NKOs generate allows for a range of novel space applications.",K & L & M,179
B,What's in a bug report?,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/whats-in-a-bug-report,"Context: Bug reports are the primary means by which users of a system are able to communicate a problem to the developers, and their contents are important - not only to support developers in maintaining the system, but also as the basis of automated tools to assist in the challenging tasks of finding and fixing bugs. Goal: This paper aims to investigate how users report bugs in systems: what information is provided, how frequently, and the consequences of this. Method: The study examined the quality and quantity of information provided in 1600 bugs reports drawn from four open-source projects (Eclipse, Firefox, Apache HTTP, and Facebook API), recorded what information users actually provide, how and when users provide the information, and how this affects the outcome of the bug. Results: Of the recorded sources of information, only observed behaviour and expected results appeared in more than 50% of reports. Those sources deemed highly useful by developers and tools such as stack traces and test cases appeared very infrequently. However, no strong relationship was observed between the provided information and the outcome of the bug. Conclusions: The paper demonstrates a clear mismatch between the information that developers would wish to appear in a bug report, and the information that actually appears. Furthermore, the quality of bug reports has an important impact on research which might rely on extracting this information automatically.",M & A,575

The data set is a sample from the Chinese consumer electronics industry. Following mainly the problem solving perspective (PSP) within the knowledge based view (KBV), we develop and test several PSP and KBV hypotheses, in conjunction with competing transaction cost economics (TCE) alternatives, in an examination of the determinants of the R&D organization mode. The results show that a firm’s existing knowledge base is the single most important explanatory variable. Problem complexity and decomposability are also found to be important, consistent with the theoretical predictions of the PSP, but it is suggested that these two dimensions need to be treated as separate variables. TCE hypotheses also receive some support, but the estimation results seem more supportive of the PSP and the KBV than the TCE.",B & C,986

By utilising the analytical solutions of the angular velocities and making use of Lax pair integration, the time evolution of the attitude of the spacecraft in a convenient quaternion form is derived. This enables repointing manoeuvres to be generated by optimising the free parameters of the analytical expressions, the initial angular velocities of the spacecraft, to match prescribed boundary conditions on the final attitude of the spacecraft. This produces reference motions which can be tracked using a simple proportional-derivative controller. The natural motions are compared in simulation to a conventional quaternion feedback controller and found to require lower accumulated torque. A simple obstacle avoidance algorithm, exploiting the analytic form of natural motions, is also described and implemented in simulation. The computational efficiency of the motion planning method is discussed.",E & F,418

The aim of this paper is to extend the model of the CR3BP to derive the LPOs in the vicinity of the Martian moon Phobos, which is becoming an appealing destination for scientific missions. The case of Phobos is particularly extreme, since the combination of both small mass-ratio and length-scale moves the collinear Libration manifold close to the moon's surface. Thus, a model of this system must consider additional dynamical perturbations, in particular the complete gravity field of Phobos, which is highly-inhomogeneous. This is accomplished using a spherical harmonics series expansion, deriving an enhanced elliptic three-body model. In this paper, we show how methodologies from dynamical systems theory are applied in differential correction continuation schemes to this proposed nonlinear model of the dynamics near Phobos, to derive the structure of the dynamical substitutes of the LPOs in this new system.  Results obtained show that the structure of the LPOs differs substantially from the classical case without harmonics. The proposed methodology allows us to identify natural periodic and quasi-periodic orbits that would provide unique low-cost opportunities for close-range observations around Phobos and high-performance landing/take-off pathways to and from Phobos' surface, which could be exploited in upcoming missions targeting the exploration of this Martian moon.",H & J,978

B,Polyhedral Study of Mixed Integer Sets Arising from Inventory Problems,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/polyhedral-study-of-mixed-integer-sets-arising-from-inventory-pro,"""Branch-and-cut"" algorithm is one of the most efficient exact approaches to solve mixed integer programs. This algorithm combines the advantages of a pure branch-and-bound approach and cutting planes scheme. Branch-and-cut algorithm computes the linear programming relaxation of the problem at each node of the search tree which is improved by the use of cuts, i.e. by the inclusion of valid inequalities. It should be taken into account that selection of strongest cuts is crucial for their effective use in branch-and-cut algorithm.

In this thesis, we focus on the derivation and use of cutting planes to solve general mixed integer problems, and in particular inventory problems combined with other problems such as distribution, supplier selection, vehicle routing, etc. In order to achieve this goal, we first consider substructures (relaxations) of such problems which are obtained by the coherent loss of information. The polyhedral structure of those simpler mixed integer sets is studied to derive strong valid inequalities. Finally those strong inequalities are included in the cutting plane algorithms to solve the general mixed integer problems.

We study three mixed integer sets in this dissertation. The first two mixed integer sets arise as a subproblem of the lot-sizing with supplier selection, the network design and the vendor-managed inventory routing problems. These sets are variants of the  well-known single node fixed-charge network set where a binary or integer variable is associated with the node. The third set occurs as a subproblem of mixed integer sets where incompatibility between binary variables is considered. We generate families of valid inequalities for those sets, identify classes of facet-defining inequalities, and discuss the separation problems associated with the inequalities. Then cutting plane frameworks are implemented to solve some mixed integer programs. Preliminary computational experiments are presented in this direction.",A,376
A,Influence of scaling effects on hub loads of a horizontal wind turbine,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/influence-of-scaling-effects-on-hub-loads-of-a-horizontal-wind-tu,"Wind industry aims to generate more energy and reduce energy cost by increasing energy capacity of machines. As a result the loading scales up non-linearly. Nowadays there is a lack of studies of variation loads (specially fatigue ones) due to the up-scaling of wind turbine. This paper aims to generate a general fatigue load trends of several wind turbines, which are available to public. The accuracy of a controller of wind turbine models was investigated by checking blade root bending moments. Subsequently, fatigue loads were calculated based on these bending moments of blade root for each wind turbine model. The obtained results demonstrated possibility to generate the general load trend among the models. Additionally the blade root loading was divided into deterministic and stochastic parts, where each part was investigated the effect on fatigue loads. Moreover, a sensitivity study was performed to identify how much of influence does wind turbulence was on fatigue loads by the increasing reference turbulence intensity.",G & H,906
A,Cepstral analysis of hypokinetic and ataxic voices: correlations with perceptual and other acoustic measures,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/cepstral-analysis-of-hypokinetic-and-ataxic-voices-correlations-w,"To investigate the validity of cepstral analyses against other conventional acoustic measures of voice quality in determining the perceptual impression in different motor speech disorders—hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria, and speech tasks—prolonged vowels and connected speech.  Prolonged vowel productions and connected speech samples (reading passages and monologues) from 43 participants with Parkinson disease and 10 speakers with ataxia were analyzed perceptually by a trained listener using GRBAS. In addition, acoustic measures of cepstral peak prominence (CPP), smoothed CPP (CPPs), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR), shimmer %, shimmer dB, amplitude perturbation quotient (APQ), relative average perturbation (RAP), jitter, and pitch perturbation quotient (PPQ) were performed. Statistical analysis involved correlations between perceptual and acoustic measures, as well as determination of differences across speaker groups and elicitation tasks.  CPP and CPPs results showed greater levels of correlation with overall dysphonia, breathiness, and asthenia ratings than the other acoustic measures, except in the case of roughness. Sustained vowel production produced a higher number of significant correlations across all parameters other than connected speech, but task choice did not affect CPP and CPPs results. There were no significant differences in any parameters across the two speaker groups.  The results of this study are consistent with the results of other studies investigating the same measures in speakers with nonmotor-related voice pathologies. In addition, there was an indication that they performed better in relation to asthenia, which might be particularly relevant for the current speaker group. The results support the clinical and research use of CPP and CPPs as a quantitative measure of voice quality in populations with motor speech disorder.",I & C & M,145
B,Combination of genetics and spatial modelling highlights the sensitivity of cod (Gadus morhua) population diversity in the North Sea to distributions of fishing,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/combination-of-genetics-and-spatial-modelling-highlights-the-sens,"Conserving genetic diversity in animal populations is important for sustaining their ability to respond to environmental change. However, the ‘between-population’ component of genetic diversity (biocomplexity) is threatened in many exploited populations, particularly marine fish, where harvest management regions may be larger than the spatial extent of genetically distinct sub-populations. Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data we delineated the geographic limits of three population units of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in northwest European waters. Two of the populations co-habit the North Sea, and trawl survey data showed differing trends in their abundances. We developed a spatial model of these units to simulate population dynamics under spatial patterns of harvesting, Competition between units during the pelagic juvenile stages in the model led to suppression of the more localised northern North Sea (Viking) unit by the more widespread (Dogger) unit, and its premature extinction under some spatial patterns of fishing. Fishery catch limits for cod are set at the scale of the whole North Sea without regard to such sub-population dynamics. Our model offers a method to quantify adjustments to regional fishing mortality rates to strike a balance between maximising sustainable yield and conserving vulnerable populations.",L,294
B,Identifying prognostic indicators for electrical treeing in solid insulation through pulse sequence analysis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/identifying-prognostic-indicators-for-electrical-treeing-in-solid,"Predictive maintenance attempts to evaluate the condition of equipment and predict the future trend of the equipment's aging, in order to reduce costs when compared to the two traditional approaches: corrective and preventive maintenance. This prediction requires an accurate prognostic model of aging. In solid insulation, the ultimate goal of prognostics is to predict the advent of failure, i.e., insulation breakdown, in terms of remaining useful life (RUL). One fault is electrical treeing, which is progressive thus leading to potentially catastrophic failure. Research has shown that diagnosis of faults can be achieved based on partial discharge (PD) monitoring [1], i.e., phase-resolved and pulse sequence analysis (PSA). This work will explore the extension of this concept towards predicting evolution of the defect: moving beyond diagnostics towards prognostics. To do this, there is a need for further investigation of prognostic features within PD characteristics leading up to breakdown. In this work, a needle-plane test arrangement was set up using a hypodermic needle and pre-formed silicone rubber as test samples. The visual observations and tree growth measurements were made using a digital microscope. PD data was captured using a radio frequency (RF) sensor and analysed using PSA. The main idea of the PSA approach is the strong relationship between two consecutive pulses caused by PD activities, which can give an understanding of the local degradation processes [1]. As for electrical treeing, a breakdown indicator in PSA is the appearance of heavily clustered data points that lie diagonally in scatter plots of the differential ratio of voltage and time of consecutive charges (Un = Δun/Δtn) [2,3]. Figure 1 shows an example of a plot that changed to a diagonal line after 14 hours of aging time. This paper investigates the formation of the diagonal line based on the distribution of the plot from the start of electrical treeing until breakdown occurs. Finally, statistical features of the PSA plot are given and will be used for lifetime prediction of insulation samples in future work.",B & H,290
C,"Methods and results of a search for gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts using the GEO 600, LIGO, and Virgo detectors",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/methods-and-results-of-a-search-for-gravitational-waves-associate,"In this paper we report on a search for short-duration gravitational wave bursts in the frequency range 64 Hz-1792 Hz associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), using data from GEO 600 and one of the LIGO or Virgo detectors. We introduce the method of a linear search grid to analyze GRB events with large sky localization uncertainties, for example the localizations provided by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). Coherent searches for gravitational waves (GWs) can be computationally intensive when the GRB sky position is not well localized, due to the corrections required for the difference in arrival time between detectors. Using a linear search grid we are able to reduce the computational cost of the analysis by a factor of O(10) for GBM events. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our analysis pipeline can improve upon the sky localization of GRBs detected by the GBM, if a high-frequency GW signal is observed in coincidence. We use the method of the linear grid in a search for GWs associated with 129 GRBs observed satellite-based gamma-ray experiments between 2006 and 2011. The GRBs in our sample had not been previously analyzed for GW counterparts. A fraction of our GRB events are analyzed using data from GEO 600 while the detector was using squeezed-light states to improve its sensitivity; this is the first search for GWs using data from a squeezed-light interferometric observatory. We find no evidence for GW signals, either with any individual GRB in this sample or with the population as a whole. For each GRB we place lower bounds on the distance to the progenitor, under an assumption of a fixed GW emission energy of 10(-2)M circle dot c(2), with a median exclusion distance of 0.8 Mpc for emission at 500 Hz and 0.3 Mpc at 1 kHz. The reduced computational cost associated with a linear search grid will enable rapid searches for GWs associated with Fermi GBM events once the advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors begin operation.",D & L,819

The resulting BMA framework can find a parsimonious PVAR specification, thus dealing with overparameterization concerns.

C,3D PiC code investigations of auroral kilometric radiation mechanisms,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/3d-pic-code-investigations-of-auroral-kilometric-radiation-mechan,"Efficient (∼1%) electron cyclotron radio emissions are known to originate in the X mode from regions of locally depleted plasma in the Earths polar magnetosphere. These emissions are commonly referred to as the Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR). AKR occurs naturally in these polar regions where electrons are accelerated by electric fields into the increasing planetary magnetic dipole. Here conservation of the magnetic moment converts axial to rotational momentum forming a horseshoe distribution in velocity phase space. This distribution is unstable to cyclotron emission with radiation emitted in the X-mode. Initial studies were conducted in the form of 2D PiC code simulations [1] and a scaled laboratory experiment that was constructed to reproduce the mechanism of AKR. As studies progressed, 3D PiC code simulations were conducted to enable complete investigation of the complex interaction dimensions. A maximum efficiency of 1.25% is predicted from these simulations in the same mode and frequency as measured in the experiment. This is also consistent with geophysical observations and the predictions of theory.",H,318

We show that arrays of connected ring traps can also be created by carefully designing the shape of the conducting loop.

Plant growth characteristics, such as chlorophyll content and shoot to root biomass, improved with sorbent amendment to varying extents and contaminant uptake to shoots was consistently reduced in amended soils.

A sample of forty 4- to 6-year-old
children from the Illawarra region in New South Wales, Australia were included
in data analysis.

Participants completed a ∼
150-min room calorimeter protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary
behaviors, light-intensity physical activities and moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities. activPAL™ accelerometer counts
were collected over 15s epochs. Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry
and direct observation were used as the criterion measure. Predicted metabolic
equivalents were calculated using the activPAL™ metabolic equivalents
equation (activPAL™ software version 5.8.0). Predictive validity was
evaluated using dependent-samples t-tests. Participants were randomly allocated
into two groups to develop and cross-validate an intensity threshold for
moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Receiver operating
characteristic curve analysis was used to determine moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities threshold. The classification accuracy
of the developed threshold was cross-validated using sensitivity, specificity,
and area under the receiver operating characteristic-curve.

The activPAL™ metabolic
equivalents equation significantly overestimated metabolic equivalents during
sedentary behaviors and significantly underestimated metabolic equivalents for
light-intensity physical activities, moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical
activities and total metabolic equivalents compared to measured metabolic
equivalents (all P<0.001). The developed threshold of ≥1418 counts per 15s
resulted in good classification accuracy for moderate-to vigorous-intensity
physical activities.

The current activPAL™ metabolic
equivalents equation requires further development before it can be used to
accurately estimate metabolic equivalents in preschoolers. The developed
threshold exhibited acceptable classification accuracy for moderate-to
vigorous-intensity physical activities; however studies cross-validating this

E,"Creative entrepreneurship and resistance: countercultural entrepreneurs' discourses, structures and practices of liberation?",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/creative-entrepreneurship-and-resistance-countercultural-entrepre,"Objectives: To explore if and how in the hands of the disenfranchised, social, cultural and (craft) human resources become creative tools of entrepreneurial resistance.

Prior work: The disenfranchised entrepreneur is contextualised in a range of marginal settings, including rural peripherality, depleted urban communities, socio-economic exclusion, counter-cultural social movements, post-colonialism, or belonging to an ethnic minority. In such settings, economic capital is typically largely absent or hard to come by, and dominant institutional structures remain firmly closed to would-be entrepreneurs. Studies are starting to show that - in contrast to dominant market-capitalism rhetorics of the heroic entrepreneur – that discourses, structures and practices of liberation are often developed by disenfranchised entrepreneurs, and especially through creative and craft entrepreneurship. 

Approach: This study explores three case studies of likely entrepreneurial resistance, all drawn from the same network of creative counter-cultural organizations in Athens: a tattoo parlour, a small chain of skate board shops, and a punk rock band. By selecting a sample drawn from the same community, analysis of the local context is enhanced. A mixture of qualitative research methods is used to gather rich longitudinal data, including semi-structured interviews, analysis of the internet and social media artefacts generated by these entrepreneurs, and participant observation. 

Results: Participants were centred towards their own worlds, beyond the mainstream (which they largely ignored), and were almost entirely engaged with the creative excellence, emotion and community this generated. 

Implications: Marginality, the position of powerlessness, can be deployed as a resource permitting a special kind of liberated entrepreneurship. Not only recognizing the barriers around established institutions (with their norms, and structures of dominance) such entrepreneurship of resistance actually turns being beyond the barriers into a space of freedom, a space of play.

Value: . Entrepreneurship,can act for the disenfranchised as a vehicle to enact “the creativity involved in moving among various cultural frameworks” (Bhabha 1990; 1994; Frenkel 2008).",F & L & B,586

Galactic cosmic rays and highly variable energetic solar particles are an ever-present hazard in interplanetary space.
Electric and/or magnetic fields have been suggested as deflection shields in the past, but these treated space as an empty vacuum. In fact it is not empty. Space contains a plasma known as the solar wind; a constant flow of protons and electrons coming from the Sun.
In this paper we explore the effectiveness of a ""mini-magnetosphere"" acting as a radiation protection shield. We explicitly include the plasma physics necessary to account for the solar wind and its induced effects. We show that, by capturing/containing this plasma, we enhance the effectiveness of the shield. Further evidence to support our conclusions can be obtained from studying naturally occurring ""mini-magnetospheres"" on the Moon. These magnetic anomalies (related to ""lunar swirls"") exhibit many of the effects seen in laboratory experiments and computer simulations.

A  dependence on a so-called area ratio is also shown relating the shrouds area to the shrouds  throat area used as a reference for aerodynamic calculations. This ratio was varied in  simulation and was found to have a marked effect on the driving forces over the shroud.  Finally, an investigation into whether helium or hydrogen should be used for this application is shown. It is found that the design of the shroud has to be aerodynamically optimized for successful operation and that the choice of which gas to employ becomes one of safety rather than enhanced performance.",I & C & M,172

B,Pension plan solvency and extreme market movements: a regime switching approach,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/pension-plan-solvency-and-extreme-market-movements-a-regime-switc,"We develop and test a new approach to assess defined benefit pension plan solvency risk in the presence of extreme market movements. Our method captures both the ‘fat-tailed’ nature of asset returns and their correlation with discount rate changes. We show that the standard assumption of constant discount rates leads to dramatic underestimation of future projections of pension plan solvency risk. Failing to incorporate leptokurtosis into asset returns also leads to downward biased estimates of risk, but this is less pronounced than the time-varying discount rate e§ect. Further modifying the model to capture the correlation between asset returns and the discount rate provides additional improvements in the projection of future pension plan solvency. This reduces the perceived future risk of underfunding because of the negative correlation between interest rate changes and asset returns. These results have important implications for those with responsibility for balancing risk against expected return when seeking to improve the current poor funding positions of defined benefit pension schemes.",B & H,271

Little is known, researched or published on the phenomenon and there are currently no apparent full-proof material solutions for the issue. The research presented here looks to develop a fuller understanding of the issue of leading edge erosion, through first reviewing the literature (both within and outwith wind energy) on the topic to put the issues in context, and then subsequently further exploring and investigating the key damage mechanisms associated rain droplet and hailstone impact on the blade leading edge; identified as two of the most erosive types of environmental exposure. Both numerical (finite element) and experimental methods are employed to identify the key damage mechanisms associated with each form of impact in the different possible blade material coating and substrate systems. It is found that for rain exposure, surface degradation and erosion is a real risk for classical gelcoat coating systems. Whereas, for newer flexible and more erosive resistant materials, interface damage and debonding from the substrate is the most likely form of damage creation. Hailstone impact is found to pose a heightened erosive threat in comparison to rain, based on individual impact damage creation; although it is recognised that hailstorms are far more infrequent than rain showers in most regions. However, it is predicted that for extreme hailstones of sufficient mass, significant substrate composite damage could also be created through impact on the leading edge. Future work and further research development aimed at further understanding the issues of blade leading edge erosion are also identified and discussed.",D & L,362

This paper considers what value can be obtained from these systems if they are used correctly. This is achieved by running simulations on an operations and maintenance model for a 20 year life cycle wind farm. The model uses Hidden Markov Models to represent both the actual system state and the observed state. The costs for system failures are derived, as are possible reductions in these costs due to early detection. Various scenarios are simulated including the addition of condition monitoring systems to the drive train and blade and tower monitoring.

D,Transgenic analysis of the Leishmania MAP kinase MPK10 reveals an auto-inhibitory mechanism crucial for stage-regulated activity and parasite viability,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/transgenic-analysis-of-the-leishmania-map-kinase-mpk10-reveals-an,"Protozoan pathogens of the genus Leishmania have evolved unique signaling mechanisms that can sense changes in the host environment and trigger adaptive stage differentiation essential for host cell infection. The signaling mechanisms underlying parasite development remain largely elusive even though Leishmania mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been linked previously to environmentally induced differentiation and virulence. Here, we unravel highly unusual regulatory mechanisms for Leishmania MAP kinase 10 (MPK10). Using a transgenic approach, we demonstrate that MPK10 is stage-specifically regulated, as its kinase activity increases during the promastigote to amastigote conversion. However, unlike canonical MAPKs that are activated by dual phosphorylation of the regulatory TxY motif in the activation loop, MPK10 activation is independent from the phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue, which is largely constitutive. Removal of the last 46 amino acids resulted in significantly enhanced MPK10 activity both for the recombinant and transgenic protein, revealing that MPK10 is regulated by an auto-inhibitory mechanism. Over-expression of this hyperactive mutant in transgenic parasites led to a dominant negative effect causing massive cell death during amastigote differentiation, demonstrating the essential nature of MPK10 auto-inhibition for parasite viability. Moreover, phosphoproteomics analyses identified a novel regulatory phospho-serine residue in the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain at position 395 that could be implicated in kinase regulation. Finally, we uncovered a feedback loop that limits MPK10 activity through dephosphorylation of the tyrosine residue of the TxY motif. Together our data reveal novel aspects of protein kinase regulation in Leishmania, and propose MPK10 as a potential signal sensor of the mammalian host environment, whose intrinsic pre-activated conformation is regulated by auto-inhibition.",I & J,747
E,Dabigatran - a continuing exemplar case history demonstrating the need for comprehensive models to optimize the utilization of new drugs,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dabigatran-a-continuing-exemplar-case-history-demonstrating-the-n,"Background: There are potential conflicts between authorities and companies to fund new premium priced drugs especially where there are effectiveness, safety and/or budget concerns. Dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant for the prevention of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), exemplifies this issue. Whilst new effective treatments are needed, there are issues in the elderly with dabigatran due to variable drug concentrations, no known antidote and dependence on renal elimination. Published studies showed dabigatran to be cost-effective but there are budget concerns given the prevalence of AF. These concerns resulted in extensive activities pre- to post-launch to manage its introduction. Objective: To (i) review authority activities across countries, (ii) use the findings to develop new models to better manage the entry of new drugs, and (iii) review the implications based on post-launch activities. Methodology: (i) Descriptive review and appraisal of activities regarding dabigatran, (ii) development of guidance for key stakeholder groups through an iterative process, (iii) refining guidance following post launch studies. Results: Plethora of activities to manage dabigatran including extensive pre-launch activities, risk sharing arrangements, prescribing restrictions and monitoring of prescribing post launch. Reimbursement has been denied in some countries due to concerns with its budget impact and/or excessive bleeding. Development of a new model and future guidance is proposed to better manage the entry of new drugs, centering on three pillars of pre-, peri-, and post-launch activities. Post-launch activities include increasing use of patient registries to monitor the safety and effectiveness of new drugs in clinical practice. Conclusion: Models for introducing new drugs are essential to optimize their prescribing especially where concerns. Without such models, new drugs may be withdrawn prematurely and/or struggle for funding. © 2014 Godman, Malmström, Diogene, Jayathissa, McTaggart, Cars, Alvarez-Madrazo, Baumgärtel, Brzezinska, Bucsics, Campbell, Eriksson, Finlayson, Fürst, Garuoliene, Gutiérrez-Ibarluzea, Hviding, Herholz, Joppi, Kalaba, Laius, Malinowska, Pedersen, Markovic-Pekovic, Piessnegger, Selke, Sermet, Spillane, Tomek, Vončina, Vlahović-Palčevski, Wale, Wladysiuk, van Woerkom, Zara and Gustafsson.",K & L & M,797
B,Development of a learning task for a process-oriented diagnostics of developmental speech sound disorders: a pilot study,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/development-of-a-learning-task-for-a-process-oriented-diagnostics,"Differential diagnosis and treatment planning of speech sound disorders (SSD) is one of the major bottlenecks in the field of pediatric speech-language pathology. The current study comprised the development and evaluation of a learning task designed to provide insight in different (sub-)processes involved in the acquisition of sensori-motor representations of novel speech sound units. Six normally developing children (aged 4.1-7.8 yrs) and five children with SSD (aged 4.3-7.5 yrs) participated in the pilot study. The learning paradigm comprised a repetition task of three speech sound units that are not present in the children’s mother tongue ([g], [ʃ], and the consonant cluster /ml/, followed by [a]) in four conditions of repetition and variation. Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of learning as well as significant differences between groups, but no group by learning interactions. Detailed analysis of the individual data show underlying profiles to vary widely per child with SSD. Furthermore, results highlighted the role of prosody in SSD, suggesting a trade-off between accuracy at the segmental and supra-segmental levels. These preliminary results are promising for the profiling of SSD and suggest that a detailed assessment of the acquisition of novel sensori-motor representations may provide direct starting points for therapy.",M & A,826
D,Dynamic optimal power flow for active distribution networks,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/dynamic-optimal-power-flow-for-active-distribution-networks,"Active Network Management is a philosophy for the operation of distribution networks with high penetrations of renewable distributed generation.Technologies such as energy storage and flexible demand are now beginning to be included in Active Network Management (ANM) schemes. Optimizing the operation of these schemes requires consideration of inter-temporal linkages as well as network power flow effects. Network effects are included in Optimal Power Flow (OPF) solutions but this only optimizes for a single point in time. Dynamic Optimal Power Flow (DOPF) is an extension of OPF to cover multiple time periods. This paper reviews the generic formulation of Dynamic Optimal Power Flow before developing a framework for modeling energy technologies with inter-temporal characteristics in an ANM context. The framework includes the optimization of non-firm connected generation, Principles of Access for non-firm generators, energy storage and flexible demand. Two objectives based on maximizing export and revenue are developed and a case study is used to illustrate the technique. Results show that DOPF is able to successfully schedule these energy technologies. DOPF schedules energy storage and flexible demand to reduce generator curtailment significantly in the case study. Finally the role of DOPF in analyzing ANM schemes is discussed with reference to extending the optimization framework to include other technologies and objectives.",B & C,276

E,The role of customer engagement behavior in value co-creation: a service system perspective,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-role-of-customer-engagement-behavior-in-value-co-creation-a-s,"Recent developments in marketing highlight the blurring of boundaries between firms and customers. The concept of customer engagement aggregates the multiple ways customer behaviors beyond transactions may influence the firm. However, the term is embryonic and academics and practitioners alike lack understanding on how customer engagement contributes to value co-creation. This paper marks the first attempt to conceptualize the role of customer engagement behavior (CEB) in value co-creation within a multi-stakeholder service system. We combine the theoretical perspectives of customer engagement and value co-creation research to the analysis of a rich case study of a public transport service system involving consumers, communities, businesses, and governmental organizations. Our findings describe drivers for CEB, identify four types of CEB, and explore the value outcomes experienced by various stakeholders. This paper proposes that CEB affects value co-creation by virtue of customers’ diverse resource contributions towards the focal firm and/other stakeholders that modify and/or augment the offering, and/or affect other stakeholders’ perceptions, preferences, expectations or actions towards the firm or its offering. Through inducing broader resource integration, CEB makes value co-creation a system level process. We offer nine research propositions explicating the connections CEB has to value co-creation by focal customers, the focal firm and other stakeholders. Our research suggests that firms focus greater attention on the resources that customers can contribute, explore the potential to engage diverse stakeholders around a common cause and employ organically emerging systems which provide opportunities for more extensive value co-creation.",E & F,276

Almost all of today's devices, however, have been designed using slow and ineffective brute-force search methods, leading in many cases to limited device performance. In this article, we provide a complete demonstration of our recently proposed inverse design technique, wherein the user specifies design constraints in the form of target fields rather than a dielectric constant profile, and in particular we use this method to demonstrate a new demultiplexing grating. The novel grating, which has not been developed using conventional techniques, accepts a vertical-incident Gaussian beam from a free-space and separates O-band (1300 nm) and C-band (1550 nm) light into separate waveguides. This inverse design concept is simple and extendable to a broad class of highly compact devices including frequency filters, mode converters, and spatial mode multiplexers.",L & K & C,739
D,Tuning the adsorption of aromatic molecules on platinum via halogenation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/tuning-the-adsorption-of-aromatic-molecules-on-platinum-via-halog,The interaction of aromatic molecules with metal surfaces is of key relevance for the functionality of molecular electronics and organic electronics devices. One way to control and tune the binding properties of molecules to metals is chemical functionalization. The adsorption of halogenated benzene molecules on the (111) surface of platinum is here investigated by density functional theory calculations with nonlocal van der Waals correlation functional. It is found that these systems exhibit a bistable adsorption energy profile with (meta)stable chemisorption and physisorption states separated by a potential energy barrier. The relative stability of these states can be tuned by functionalizing benzene with a different number or type of halogen atoms. Our results suggest a simple rational molecular design to achieve the desired interfacial binding in organic electronic devices and in composites with interfaces between large aromatic molecules and metals.,A & D,529

The budgets of Britain’s public services have been under sustained pressure and public libraries are no exception to public spending cuts in today’s “age of austerity”. Librarians increasingly try to supplement shrinking budgets by employing a variety of income generation methods. But are these methods always in line with the public library ethos? This article presents data showing what British librarians hold to be the public library ethos, what they undertake to generate extra income to maintain public library services and whether they think that their efforts to generate additional income are ever in contradiction to the public library ethos. The article is based on survey and interview data produced in 2013 and also provides, in a Supplementary File, a comprehensive list of income generation methods.

B,Comparing text-based and dependence-based approaches for determining the origins of bugs,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/comparing-text-based-and-dependence-based-approaches-for-determin,"Identifying bug origins – the point where erroneous code was introduced – is crucial for many software engineering activities, from identifying process weaknesses to gathering data to support bug detection tools. Unfortunately, this information is not usually recorded when fixing bugs, and recovering it later is challenging. Recently, the text approach and the dependence approach have been developed to tackle this problem. Respectively, they examine textual and dependence-related changes that occurred prior to a bug fix. However, only limited evaluation has been carried out, partially because of a lack of available implementations and of datasets linking bugs to origins. To address this, origins of 174 bugs in three projects were manually identified and compared to a simulation of the approaches. Both approaches were partially successful across a variety of bugs – achieving 29–79% precision and 40–70% recall. Results suggested the precise definition of program dependence could affect performance, as could whether the approaches identified a single or multiple origins. Some potential improvements are explored in detail and identify pragmatic strategies for combining techniques along with simple modifications. Even after adopting these improvements, there remain many challenges: large commits, unrelated changes and long periods between origins and fixes all reduce effectiveness.",A,814

Instead template matching based on the sum of weighted absolute differences (SWAD) can track a target precisely, even under partial occlusion. To take advantage of both trackers, this paper presents a novel tracking algorithm that, on one side, further improves the IMS and extends it to a more general and flexible framework; on the other side, the proposed algorithm incorporates SWAD minimisation to increase the precision of the tracking results. Experimental results demonstrate that such an algorithm can robustly and precisely track targets with fast motion and in complete occlusion, more than conventional mean shift, IMS and SWAD-based trackers taken separately.",G & H,367

Previous studies have intimated that 1 existed as a single species in THF solution formulated as [(THF)·Li(μ-TMP)(μ-iBu)Al( iBu)2] 1·THF, having a contacted ion pair structure as evidenced by an X-ray crystallographic study of isolated crystals. But here using anisole as a case substrate it is revealed that pre-crystallised 1·THF cannot deprotonate anisole at all whether in hexane or THF solution contradicting earlier in situ applications of 1 which revealed near quantitative metallation of anisole. NMR spectroscopic studies of 1 made in situ in THF solution ascribe this reactivity distinction from 1·THF to complex equilibria involving five major species in LiTMP·THF, Al( iBu)3·THF, [{Li(THF)4} +{Al(TMP)(iBu)3}-] 1·(THF)4, [(THF)·Li(μ-TMP)(μ-OC4H 7)Al(iBu)2], 4, and (TMP)Al( iBu)2·THF. Reagent 2 in contrast is found to exist as only two separated homometallic species in LiTMP·THF and (TMP)Al( iBu)2·THF in THF solution. The constitutions of 1 and 2 in non-polar hexane solution are also revealed. With the aid of DFT calculations, discussion focuses on the fact that none of the aluminate species present in THF solutions of 1 or 2 can deprotonate/metallate anisole, instead the metallation processes appear to be LiTMP lithiations followed immediately by trapping by an alkylaluminium complex, in a metal exchange which drives the reaction to the product (arylaluminated) side.",I & C & M,800
B,Attributable fraction of tobacco smoking on cancer using population-based nationwide cancer incidence and mortality data in Korea,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/attributable-fraction-of-tobacco-smoking-on-cancer-using-populati,"Smoking is by far the most important cause of cancer that can be modified at the individual level. Cancer incidence and mortality rates in Korea are the highest among all Asian countries, and smoking prevalence in Korean men is one of the highest in developed countries. The purpose of the current study was to perform a systematic review and provide an evidence-based assessment of the burden of tobacco smoking-related cancers in the Korean population. Sex- and cancer-specific population-attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated using the prevalence of ever-smoking and second-hand smoking in 1989 among Korean adults, respectively, and the relative risks were estimated from the meta-analysis of studies performed in the Korean population for ever-smoking and in the Asian population for passive smoking. National cancer incidence data from the Korea Central Cancer Registry and national cancer mortality data from Statistics Korea for the year 2009 were used to estimate the cancer cases and deaths attributable to tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoking was responsible for 20,239 (20.9%) cancer incident cases and 14,377 (32.9%) cancer deaths among adult men and 1,930 (2.1%) cancer incident cases and 1,351 (5.2%) cancer deaths among adult women in 2009 in Korea. In men, 71% of lung cancer deaths, 55%-72% of upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus and larynx) cancer deaths, 23% of liver, 32% of stomach, 27% of pancreas, 7% of kidney and 45% of bladder cancer deaths were attributable to tobacco smoking. In women the proportion of ever-smoking-attributable lung cancer was 8.1%, while that attributable to second-hand smoking among non-smoking women was 20.5%. Approximately one in three cancer deaths would be potentially preventable through appropriate control of tobacco smoking in Korean men at the population level and individual level. For Korean women, more lung cancer cases and deaths were attributable to second-hand than ever-smoking. Effective control programs against tobacco smoking should be further developed and implemented in Korea to reduce the smoking-related cancer burden.",L,289

Most notably, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, computerisation and the microchip prompted cataclysmic predictions regarding their effects for employment.

In the aftermath of speculation on the ‘Information Revolution’, whether dystopian (Jenkins and Sherman, 1979) or utopian (Toffler, 1970), New Technology, Work and Employment was established as corrective and as a forum for theoretically informed, empirically grounded research on the impact of technological developments on work, employment and workplace social relations.

But does length also affect the choice between different forms of referring expressions? Three experiments investigated the effect of antecedent length on the choice between pronouns (e.g., he) and repeated nouns (e.g., the actor) using a sentence-continuation paradigm. Experiments 1 and 2 found an effect of antecedent length on written continuations: Participants used more pronouns (relative to repeated nouns) when the antecedent was longer than when it was shorter. Experiment 3 used a spoken continuation task and replicated the effect of antecedent length on the choice of referring expressions. Taken together, the results suggest that longer antecedents increase the likelihood of pronominal reference. The results support theories arguing that length enhances the accessibility of the associated entity through richer semantic encoding.",E & F & G,486

Because every generalized angulated element (GAE) subtends a constant angle during the motion, every angulated link was assumed as a PRRP linkage which has two prismatic joints and two revolute joints. Therefore, the two PRRP linkages of the GAE are individually movable with a single degree of freedom. The mobility of two types of GAEs was investigated with the method based on the screw theory. It has been proven that both types of GAEs are movable because the terminal constraints exerted to the common joint by the two linkages are equal.",I & J,341
E,A novel technique to incorporate structural prior information into multi-modal tomographic reconstruction,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-novel-technique-to-incorporate-structural-prior-information-int,"There has been a rapid expansion of multi-modal imaging techniques in tomography. In biomedical imaging, patients are now regularly imaged using both single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and x-ray computed tomography (CT), or using both positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In non-destructive testing of materials both neutron CT (NCT) and x-ray CT are widely applied to investigate the inner structure of material or track the dynamics of physical processes. The potential benefits from combining modalities has led to increased interest in iterative reconstruction algorithms that can utilize the data from more than one imaging mode simultaneously. We present a new regularization term in iterative reconstruction that enables information from one imaging modality to be used as a structural prior to improve resolution of the second modality. The regularization term is based on a modified anisotropic tensor diffusion filter, that has shape-adapted smoothing properties. By considering the underlying orientations of normal and tangential vector fields for two co-registered images, the diffusion flux is rotated and scaled adaptively to image features. The images can have different greyscale values and different spatial resolutions. The proposed approach is particularly good at isolating oriented features in images which are important for medical and materials science applications. By enhancing the edges it enables both easy identification and volume fraction measurements aiding segmentation algorithms used for quantification. The approach is tested on a standard denoising and deblurring image recovery problem, and then applied to 2D and 3D reconstruction problems; thereby highlighting the capabilities of the algorithm. Using synthetic data from SPECT co-registered with MRI, and real NCT data co-registered with x-ray CT, we show how the method can be used across a range of imaging modalities.",K & L & M,171
B,External lightning protection system for wind turbine blades: preliminary aerodynamic results,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/external-lightning-protection-system-for-wind-turbine-blades-prel,"In general, there are three components making up a lightning protection system for wind turbines. These are the receptors, the down conductor and the grounding grid. Receptors and down conductors are usually found in the more recent wind turbine blades and where the down conductors are normally installed on the internal side of the blade. Consequently, the blades are vulnerable to damage and burn resulting from lightning strikes. The authors believe that a system with an external down conductor is likely to reduce the risk of damage when compared to the system having an internal down conductor. One could envisage an external down conductor would look similar to the one installed on a building or an aircraft. However, external down conductors may compromise the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. This paper reports the effect of external down conductors on the pressure coefficient distribution around the turbine blade. The blade profile (aerofoil) used is according to NACA 4418. Numerical simulations, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), were conducted on an aerofoil without and with external down conductors of 1mm thickness. The k-ɛ turbulence model that is incorporated in COMSOL Multiphysics (CFD Module) was used for the simulation and the wind speed and angle of attack used was 5 m/s and 5˚ respectively. The preliminary results show that the degradation on aerodynamic properties may not be too significant and these indicate that external down conductor arrangement could be considered.",M & A,748
D,Systematic design of the lead-lag network method for active damping in LCL-filter based three phase converters,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/systematic-design-of-the-lead-lag-network-method-for-active-dampi,"Three-phase active rectifiers guarantee sinusoidal input currents and unity power factor at the price of a high switching frequency ripple. To adopt an LCL-filter, instead of an $L$-filter, allows using reduced values for the inductances and so preserving dynamics. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop if the present resonance is not properly damped. Passive damping simply adds resistors in series with the LCL-filter capacitors. This simplicity is at the expense of increased losses and encumbrances. Active damping modifies the control algorithm to attain stability without using dissipative elements but, sometimes, needing additional sensors. This solution has been addressed in many publications. The lead-lag network method is one of the first reported procedures and continues being in use. However, neither there is a direct tuning procedure (without trial and error) nor its rationale has been explained. Thus, in this paper a straightforward procedure is developed to tune the lead-lag network with the help of software tools. The rationale of this procedure, based on the capacitor current feedback, is elucidated. Stability is studied by means of the root locus analysis in $z$-plane. Selecting the lead-lag network for the maximum damping in the closed-loop poles uses a simple optimization algorithm. The robustness against the grid inductance variation is also analyzed. Simulations and experiments confirm the validity of the proposed design flow.",B & C,985
A,Combined wind turbine fatigue and ultimate load reduction by individual blade control,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/combined-wind-turbine-fatigue-and-ultimate-load-reduction-by-indi,"If each blade of the wind turbine has individual pitch actuator, there is possibility of employing the pitch system to mitigate structural loads through advanced control methods. Previously, considerable reduction of blade lifetime equivalent fatigue loads has been achieved by Individual Blade Control (IBC) and in addition, it has also been shown the potential in blade ultimate loads reduction. However, both fatigue and ultimate loads impact on the design and life of wind turbine blades. In this paper, the design and application of IBC that concurrently reduce both blade fatigue and ultimate loads is investigated. The contributions of blade load spectral components, which are 1P, 2P and edgewise mode from blade in-plane and/or out-of-plane bending moments, are firstly explored. Four different control options for reducing various combinations of these load components are compared. In response to the different spectral peaks of both fatigue and ultimate loads, the controller has been designed so that it can act on different frequency components which vary with wind speed. The performance of the IBC controller on fatigue and ultimate load reduction is assessed by simulating a 5MW exemplar wind turbine. Simulation results show that with a proper selection of controlling inputs at different wind speed, the use of a single combined IBC can achieve satisfactory reduction on both fatigue and ultimate loads.",B & C & D,699

Adults who stammer (AWS) have previously informed discussion regarding speech and language therapy (SLT) services; however, contemporary UK perspectives are lacking.
Aim: This study aimed to identify features of helpful and unhelpful SLT services for AWS from the client and potential user perspective. Highlighting preferred components of therapy from this standpoint can help to ensure that SLT services are client-centred.
Methods: An online survey was conducted using questions largely derived from UK professional guidelines of minimum best practice. Responses were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Results: Both positive and negative aspects of individual and group therapy for AWS were identified. Ideal service characteristics related to ‘therapy and therapist’ and ‘service delivery’ issues. Results were generally consistent with previous similar studies. In addition, consideration of the place of remote
communication methods within therapy highlighted an appetite for such practice.
Conclusions: SLT facilitated long-term benefits for the majority of respondents, but future service design could incorporate greater flexibility in the: timing of therapy; therapeutic format; choice of therapist; and use of technology. The relevance of these findings for allied health services is acknowledged.",H & J,451
C,"Hearing in the crepuscular owl butterfly (Caligo eurilochus, Nymphalidae)",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/hearing-in-the-crepuscular-owl-butterfly-emcaligo-eurilochusem-ny,"Tympanal organs are widespread in  Nymphalidae butterflies, with a great deal of variability in the morphology of these ears. How this variation reflects differences in hearing physiology is not currently understood. This study provides the first examination of the hearing organs of the crepuscular owl butterfly, Caligo eurilochus. We hypothesize that (1) its hearing may function to detect the high-frequency calls of bats, or (2) like its diurnal relatives it may function to detect avian predators, or (3) it may have lost auditory sensitivity as a result of the lack of selective pressures. To test these hypotheses we examined the tuning and sensitivity of the C. eurilochus Vogel’s organ using laser Doppler vibrometry and extracellular neurophysiology. We show that the C. eurilochus ear responds to sound and is most sensitive to frequencies between 1-4 kHz, as confirmed by both the vibration of the tympanal membrane and the physiological response of the associated nerve branches. In comparison to the hearing of its diurnally active relative, Morpho peleides, C. eurilochus has a narrower frequency range with higher auditory thresholds. We conclude that hearing in this butterfly is partially-regressed, and may reflect a trade-off between hearing and vision for survival in low light conditions.",L & K & C,807

Based on interviews with 38 LGBT, ‘religious’ young people, this article examines Facebook, as well as wider social networking sites and the online environment and communities. Engaging with the key concept of ‘online embodiment’, this article takes a closer analysis of embodiment, emotion and temporality to approach the role of Facebook in the lives of queer religious youth. Furthermore, it explores the methodological dilemmas evoked by the presence of Facebook in qualitative research with specific groups of young people.",A & D,783
E,Underwater mixed environments,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/underwater-mixed-environments,"In this chapter we give a systematic overview over Virtual Reality (VR) and  Augmented Reality (AR) in underwater settings. Based on a novel classification scheme we illustrate the broad range of available and future implementation options. Whilst we find a variety of previous work on creating and using virtual underwater worlds, quite few examples of real underwater settings exist up to now. So we concentrate on this new category, sketch attractive application areas that go beyond entertainment and derive requirements for Underwater Mixed Environments (UWME). Combined with a short summary on relevant aspects of underwater optics, we formulate some topics of future research to overcome current limitations of UWME.",F & L & B,152
A,Understanding patterns and processes in models of trophic cascades,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/understanding-patterns-and-processes-in-models-of-trophic-cascade,"Climate fluctuations and human exploitation are causing global changes in nutrient enrichment of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and declining abundances of apex predators. The resulting trophic cascades have had profound effects on food webs, leading to significant economic and societal consequences. However, the strength of cascades – that is the extent to which a disturbance is diminished as it propagates through a food web - varies widely between ecosystems, and there is no formal theory as to why this should be so. Some food chain models reproduce cascade effects seen in nature, but to what extent is this dependent on their formulation? We show that inclusion of processes represented mathematically as density-dependent regulation of either consumer uptake or mortality rates is necessary for the generation of realistic “top-down” cascades in simple food chain models. Realistically modelled “bottom-up” cascades, caused by changing nutrient input, are also depend on the inclusion of density-dependence, but especially on mortality regulation as a caricature of e.g. disease and parasite dynamics or intra-guild predation. We show that our conclusions, based on simple food chains, transfer to a more complex marine food web model in which cascades are induced by varying river nutrient inputs or fish harvesting rates.",E,664
B,"A scalable, minimal contact device for the characterization of elastomer membrane deformation",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-scalable-minimal-contact-device-for-the-characterization-of-ela,We have developed a simple microfluidic device that allows us to model the peak deflection experienced by an elastomer membrane when under a dynamic pneumatic or hydraulic actuation. The device uses fluidic displacement principles to accurately display the volume change experienced by an expanding membrane. This volume change is then used to calculate the peak deflection height of the membrane. The device has been fabricated using already well established dry film techniques commonly used in the field of microfluidics. Its simple design does not require any complex or expensive electronics and experimental results show the device's ability to record deflections over a range of membrane diameters down to a resolution of 38 μm. Simple geometry changes can allow nanoscale resolution measurements. The device represents a low cost method of membrane deflection characterization at the micro and nanoscales.,A,320
A,Sustainable urban qualities in the emerging city of Doha,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/sustainable-urban-qualities-in-the-emerging-city-of-doha,"Various urban qualities are required for sustainable urban development, which is a particular challenge in the case of emerging cities such as Qatar's capital, Doha. Therefore, this paper seeks to introduce a framework concerning how to investigate urban qualities and their production in space in order to clarify the challenges and limitations of planning for sustainability. The paper is based on analyses and evaluations of GIS data as well as a series of interviews with 10 planning experts at the Ministry of Municipalities and Urban Planning and a series of questionnaires received from 350 inhabitants. After introducing the basic framework as a model, the three dimensions of sustainability - ecological efficiency, economic growth and social equity - are analysed in relation to the urban qualities needed for producing them. In conclusion the general challenges in establishing sustainable urban development mechanisms in Doha are discussed.",G & H,422
A,Practical strategies to stabilize a nanosatellite platform with a space camera and integrated mechanical parts,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/practical-strategies-to-stabilize-a-nanosatellite-platform-with-a,"The growth and speed of nanosatellite capabilities has led to an increasing demand on the respective attitude control systems. Typically, nanosatellites utilise minaturised reaction wheels for 3-axis stabilisation/manoeuvres, which are desaturated using magnetorquers. 

Small space telescopes have been deployed from nanosatellites in the past with capability ever increasing to push the limit of detectors.  Previous work has established the feasibility of achieving GSD of 0.7 m in low Earth orbit for a 2.5 U CubeSat using deployable mirrors from a 400 km orbit. 

The dynamic model of nanosatellite with the telescope + the deployed mirror systems will be built in this research work. The deployed mirror system will use a diamond turned mirror - it's an off axis paraboloid. The mirror would be light-weighted as much as possible, i.e. the back surface would be carved away with good thermal stability.  The mechanisms for mirror systems may use methods like minature geared motors, stiction motors and shape memory alloy hinges. The sensoring and directing of the mirror surface will use an image based detection methods. A closed loop control of the mirror position will be used to iterate to a fully aligned system. This work also considers control strategies to stabilise such a platform against the effects of firstly, the external aerodynamics and secondly, any internal disturbances induced by and the movement of focussing elements.  A pointing accuracy of 5-10 arcsec for a 20 min observation over the UK is targeted at a baseline orbit of 350 km sun-synchronous. 

Following an initial baseline to establish current state-of-art both based on in-orbit performance and off-the-shelf subsystems available to the market within the constraints of a 3U nanosatellite system, a number of feed-forward/feedback control loops and sensor systems are studied to determine a simple process for compensating for the motion.",I & C & M,930
B,Extrinsic tau-coupling and the regulation of interceptive reaching under varying task constraints,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/extrinsic-tau-coupling-and-the-regulation-of-interceptive-reachin,"We investigated a general theory accounting for the guidance of ongoing movements in an interceptive reaching task. The aim was to assess the premise of tau-coupling that the coupling constant k, the ratio of taus(τs) of motion gaps between hand and object, reflects the kinematics of the on-going movement. The spatial and temporal constraints of the interceptive action were manipulated in three task conditions. While the time dependent counterpart of k, K(t) exhibited task effects, k itself could not distinguish between task manipulations. K(t) showed large variability during the initial acceleration phase, small variability during the rest of the movement, and task dependent changes during the final deceleration phase of interception. The findings highlight the importance of clarifying what constitutes as τ-coupling.",L,881
B,"Radially polarized, half-cycle, attosecond pulses from laser wakefields through coherent synchrotron radiation",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/radially-polarized-half-cycle-attosecond-pulses-from-laser-wakefi,"Attosecond bursts of coherent synchrotron-like radiation are found when driving ultrathin relativistic electron disks in a quasi-one-dimensional regime of wakefield acceleration, in which the laser waist is larger than the wake wavelength. The disks of overcritical density shrink radially due to the focusing wake fields, thus providing the transverse currents for the emission of an intense, radially polarized, half-cycle pulse of about 100 attoseconds in duration. The electromagnetic pulse first focuses to a peak intensity 10 times larger ($7\times10^{20}\rm W/cm^2$) than the driving pulse and then emerges as a conical beam. Saturation of the emission amplitudes is derived analytically and in agreement with particle-in-cell simulation. By making use of gas targets instead of solids to form the ultrathin disks, the new scheme allows for high repetition rate required for applications.",B & H,565

This is facilitated through new technological developments and an evolution of current systems to tackle challenging problems. It is therefore important to continually update both the scientific and commercial communities on current system performance and limitations. To achieve this objective, this paper addresses two key aspects of high-power ultrasonic systems. In the first part, the review of high-power applications focuses on industrial applications and documents the developing technology from its early cleaning applications through to the advanced sonochemistry, cutting, and water treatment applications used today. The second part provides a comprehensive overview of measurement techniques used in conjunction with high-power ultrasonic systems. This is an important and evolving field which enables design and process engineers to optimize the behaviour and/or operation of key metrics of system performance, such as field distribution or cavitation intensity.",D & L,240
A,Scaled experiment to investigate auroral kilometric radiation mechanisms in the presence of background electrons,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/scaled-experiment-to-investigate-auroral-kilometric-radiation-mec,"Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) emissions occur at frequencies ∼300kHz polarised in the X-mode with efficiencies ∼1-2% [1,2] in the auroral density cavity in the polar regions of the Earth's magnetosphere, a region of low density plasma ∼3200km above the Earth's surface, where electrons are accelerated down towards the Earth whilst undergoing magnetic compression. As a result of this magnetic compression the electrons acquire a horseshoe distribution function in velocity space. Previous theoretical studies have predicted that this distribution is capable of driving the cyclotron maser instability. To test this theory a scaled laboratory experiment was constructed to replicate this phenomenon in a controlled environment, [3-5] whilst 2D and 3D simulations are also being conducted to predict the experimental radiation power and mode, [6-9]. The experiment operates in the microwave frequency regime and incorporates a region of increasing magnetic field as found at the Earth's pole using magnet solenoids to encase the cylindrical interaction waveguide through which an initially rectilinear electron beam (12A) was accelerated by a 75keV pulse. Experimental results showed evidence of the formation of the horseshoe distribution function. The radiation was produced in the near cut-off TE01 mode, comparable with X-mode characteristics, at 4.42GHz. Peak microwave output power was measured ∼35kW and peak efficiency of emission ∼2%, [3]. A Penning trap was constructed and inserted into the interaction waveguide to enable generation of a background plasma which would lead to closer comparisons with the magnetospheric conditions. Initial design and measurements are presented showing the principle features of the new geometry.",A & G,250

Screening of a library of ES-62 phosphorylcholine-based small molecule analogues (SMAs) revealed that two compounds, termed 11a and 12b, mirrored the helminth product both in inhibiting mast cell degranulation and cytokine responses in vitro and in preventing ovalbumin-induced Th2-associated airway inflammation and eosin- ophil infiltration of the lungs in mice. Furthermore, the two SMAs inhibited neutrophil infiltration of the

We show that a TTF moiety appended with diphenylalanine amide derivative (TTF-FF-NH2) self-assembles into one-dimensional nanofibers that further lead to the formation of self-supporting organogels in chloroform and ethyl acetate. Upon doping of the gels with electron acceptors (TCNQ/iodine vapor), stable two-component charge transfer gels are produced in chloroform and ethyl acetate. These gels are characterized by various spectroscopy (UV-vis-NIR, FTIR and CD), microscopy (AFM and TEM), rheology and cyclic voltammetry techniques. Furthermore, conductivity measurements performed on TTF-FF-NH2 xerogel nanofiber networks formed between gold electrodes on a glass surface indicate that these nanofibers show a remarkable enhancement in the conductivity after doping with TCNQ.",D,742
D,Rivulet flow round a horizontal cylinder subject to a uniform surface shear stress,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/rivulet-flow-round-a-horizontal-cylinder-subject-to-a-uniform-sur,"The steady flow of a slowly varying rivulet with prescribed flux in the azimuthal direction round a large stationary horizontal cylinder subject to a prescribed uniform azimuthal surface shear stress is investigated. In particular, we focus on the case where the volume flux is downwards but the shear stress is upwards, for which there is always a solution corresponding to a rivulet flowing down at least part of one side of the cylinder. We consider both a rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle but slowly varying width (i.e. de-pinned contact lines) and a rivulet with constant width but slowly varying contact angle (i.e. pinned contact lines), and show that they have qualitatively different behaviour. When shear is present, a rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle can never run all the way from the top to the bottom of the cylinder, and so we consider the scenario in which an infinitely wide two-dimensional film of uniform thickness covers part of the upper half of the cylinder and ""breaks"" into a single rivulet with constant non-zero contact angle. In contrast, a sufficiently narrow rivulet with constant width can run all the way from the top to the bottom of the cylinder, whereas a wide rivulet can do so only if its contact lines de-pin, and so we consider the scenario in which the contact lines of a wide rivulet de-pin on the lower half of the cylinder.",C,659
E,An agent-based implementation of hidden Markov models for gas turbine condition monitoring,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/an-agent-based-implementation-of-hidden-markov-models-for-gas-tur,"This paper considers the use of a multi-agent system (MAS) incorporating hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the condition monitoring of gas turbine (GT) engines. Hidden Markov models utilizing a Gaussian probability distribution are proposed as an anomaly detection tool for gas turbines components. The use of this technique is shown to allow the modeling of the dynamics of GTs despite a lack of high frequency data. This allows the early detection of developing faults and avoids costly outages due to asset failure. These models are implemented as part of a MAS, using a proposed extension of an established power system ontology, for fault detection of gas turbines. The multi-agent system is shown to be applicable through a case study and comparison to an existing system utilizing historic data from a combined-cycle gas turbine plant provided by an industrial partner.",B & E,455
B,Constraints on cosmic strings from the LIGO-virgo gravitational-wave detectors,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/constraints-on-cosmic-strings-from-the-ligo-virgo-gravitational-w,"Cosmic strings can give rise to a large variety of interesting astrophysical phenomena. Among them, powerful bursts of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by cusps are a promising observational signature. In this Letter we present a search for GWs from cosmic string cusps in data collected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors between 2005 and 2010, with over 625 days of live time. We find no evidence of GW signals from cosmic strings. From this result, we derive new constraints on cosmic string parameters, which complement and improve existing limits from previous searches for a stochastic background of GWs from cosmic microwave background measurements and pulsar timing data. In particular, if the size of loops is given by the gravitational backreaction scale, we place upper limits on the string tension G mu below 10-8 in some regions of the cosmic string parameter space.",E & F,431
D,Tribo-corrosion of steel in artificial saliva,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/tribo-corrosion-of-steel-in-artificial-saliva,"Stainless steel is widely used as dental implant. However, there has been little work on the micro-abrasion of such materials in laboratory simulated oral environments, where abrasion, sliding wear can interact simultaneously. In this study, the effects of applied load, and exposure time were evaluated for a 316 stainless steel in a laboratory simulated artificial saliva. Polarization curves showed an enhancement of corrosion current density with increases in applied load. Wear maps were produced showing low wear safety regimes at intermediate loads and exposure times. Possible reasons for such trends are interpreted in terms of the ability of the passive film in providing resistance against third body particle impact and the concentration of particles in the contact at higher loads.",F & K,964
A,Natural and vaccine-mediated immunity to Salmonella Typhimurium is impaired by the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/natural-and-vaccine-mediated-immunity-to-salmonella-typhimurium-i,"The impact of exposure to multiple pathogens concurrently or consecutively on immune function is unclear. Here, immune responses induced by combinations of the bacterium Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) and the helminth Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb), which causes a murine hookworm infection and an experimental porin protein vaccine against STm, were examined. Mice infected with both STm and Nb induced similar numbers of Th1 and Th2 lymphocytes compared with singly infected mice, as determined by flow cytometry, although lower levels of secreted Th2, but not Th1 cytokines were detected by ELISA after re-stimulation of splenocytes. Furthermore, the density of FoxP3+ T cells in the T zone of co-infected mice was lower compared to mice that only received Nb, but was greater than those that received STm. This reflected the intermediate levels of IL-10 detected from splenocytes. Co-infection compromised clearance of both pathogens, with worms still detectable in mice weeks after they were cleared in the control group. Despite altered control of bacterial and helminth colonization in co-infected mice, robust extrafollicular Th1 and Th2-reflecting immunoglobulin-switching profiles were detected, with IgG2a, IgG1 and IgE plasma cells all detected in parallel. Whilst extrafollicular antibody responses were maintained in the first weeks after co-infection, the GC response was less than that in mice infected with Nb only. Nb infection resulted in some abrogation of the longer-term development of anti-STm IgG responses. This suggested that prior Nb infection may modulate the induction of protective antibody responses to vaccination. To assess this we immunized mice with porins, which confer protection in an antibody-dependent manner, before challenging with STm. Mice that had resolved a Nb infection prior to immunization induced less anti-porin IgG and had compromised protection against infection. These findings demonstrate that co-infection can radically alter the development of protective immunity during natural infection and in response to immunization.",M & I,907

C,What's the use of ethical philosophy? the role of ethical theory in special educational needs,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/whats-the-use-of-ethical-philosophy-the-role-of-ethical-theory-in,"This article examines the relevance of modern moral philosophy to education, with particular reference to special educational needs. Where moral philosophers explore the tension between utilitarian and deontological reasoning, they often consider the balance between the rights of the individual and the benefits or costs for the majority. I argue that the debate is predicated on a false dichotomy between minority and majority which is best overcome by a return to virtue ethics. In exploring this ethical debate, I draw on a case study from Australia of a student excluded from mainstream education on the basis that inclusion will not serve the greater good of the majority of students. My intention here is not to offer practical guidance in the complex day-to-day deliberations of educators dealing with issues of inclusion, but to elaborate the structure of the present thinking about inclusion. It is hoped that an appreciation of the deeper basis of ethical reasoning will itself lead to a greater recognition of the need for exploring the ethical grounds of teaching and learning. I will argue that any dichotomy between the utilitarian happiness of the many and the deontological commitment to the rights of the individual is based on a misconception of human identity. The false choice between the many and the one rests upon the assumption that morality is fundamentally about restricting personal preferences in favour of the good of the majority, that there exists a fundamental conflict between what is good for the individual and what is good for society as a whole. This will lead me to argue that we need to reinterpret human identity as constituted by its social relations and that this reorientation is best achieved by reference to virtue ethics.",E & A,932

D,Energy spectra of finite temperature superfluid helium-4 turbulence,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/energy-spectra-of-finite-temperature-superfluid-helium-4-turbulen,"A mesoscopic model of finite temperature superfluid helium-4 based on coupled Langevin-Navier-Stokes dynamics is proposed. Drawing upon scaling arguments and available numerical results, a numerical method for designing well resolved, mesoscopic calculations of finite temperature superfluid turbulence is developed. The application of model and numerical method to the problem of fully developed turbulence decay in helium II, indicates that the spectral structure of normal-fluid and superfluid turbulence is significantly more complex than that of turbulence in simple-fluids. Analysis based on a forced flow of helium-4 at 1.3 K, where viscous dissipation in the normal-fluid is compensated by the Lundgren force, indicate three scaling regimes in the normal-fluid, that include the inertial, low wavenumber, Kolmogorov k?5/3 regime, a sub-turbulence, low Reynolds number, fluctuating k?2.2 regime, and an intermediate, viscous k?6 range that connects the two. The k?2.2 regime is due to normal-fluid forcing by superfluid vortices at high wavenumbers. There are also three scaling regimes in the superfluid, that include a k?3 range that corresponds to the growth of superfluid vortex instabilities due to mutual-friction action, and an adjacent, low wavenumber, k?5/3 regime that emerges during the termination of this growth, as superfluid vortices agglomerate between intense normal-fluid vorticity regions, and weakly polarized bundles are formed. There is also evidence of a high wavenumber k?1 range that corresponds to the probing of individual-vortex velocity fields. The Kelvin waves cascade (the main dynamical effect in zero temperature superfluids) appears to be damped at the intervortex space scale.",H & L,592

These arise from the configurations 1s2 2s2 2p6 3 {s,p,d} nl with n = 4,5, and for l = 0−4. We obtain ordinary collision strengths and Maxwell-averaged effective collision strengths for the electron-impact excitation of all the ions of the Mg-like sequence, from Al+ to Zn18 +. We compare our results with those from previous R-matrix and distorted waves calculations, where available, for some benchmark ions.

A,New civil engineer: introducing undergraduate civil engineers to construction technology,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/new-civil-engineer-introducing-undergraduate-civil-engineers-to-c,"Undergraduate (UG) civil engineering students should graduate from university with knowledge that links their computational competence in structural engineering and mechanics to construction technology principles, processes and practice. However, there appears to be a paucity of evidence to suggest that UG civil engineering students receive sufficient instruction in construction technology throughout their degree studies. This paper presents evidence from a study employing the weekly New Civil Engineer (NCE) publication as a vehicle for introducing construction technology to first year students. The results reveal that students found this publication interesting and inspirational.
Whilst this innovative approach to teaching construction technology would be best ‘blended’ throughout the UG course, its introduction, application and success arguably requires a multi-disciplinary and carefully ‘engineered’ approach.

B,Towards human-oriented norms: investigating the effects of noise exposure on board ships,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/towards-human-oriented-norms-investigating-the-effects-of-noise-e,"With current trends showing a decrease in crew numbers on board ships together with increased operational demands as well as increased paperwork, crew fatigue and comfort has become more critical and recently been given more importance. It is known that environmental factors have an effect on crew comfort and performance. The two outstanding environmental factors which exist in the shipboard environment are ship motions and noise, moreover, in these two areas the findings and lessons learnt from other industrial sectors are considered to be less relevant. Therefore, it was necessary to conduct research to understand the effects of these factors, so that, the lessons learnt can be integrated into design process in order to eliminate the adverse effects of the aforementioned two factors during operation. Due to having more obvious performance outcomes ship motions and motion sickness research attracted more interest where human response to noise have been neglected so far.

A,The Impacts of Temporary and Anticipated Tourism Spending,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-impacts-of-temporary-and-anticipated-tourism-spending,"Part of the local economic impact of a major sporting event comes from the associated temporary tourism expenditures. Typically demand-driven Input-Output (IO) methods are used to quantify the impacts of such expenditures. However, IO modelling has specific weaknesses when measuring temporary tourism impacts; particular problems lie in its treatment of factor supplies and its lack of dynamics. Recent work argues that Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis is more appropriate and this has been widely applied. Neglected in this literature however is an understanding of the role that behavioural characteristics and factor supply assumptions play in determining the economic impact of tourist expenditures, particularly where expenditures are temporary (i.e. of limited duration) and anticipated (i.e. known in advance). This paper uses a CGE model for Scotland in which agents can have myopic- or forward-looking behaviours and shows how these alternative specifications affect the timing and scale of the economic impacts from anticipated and temporary tourism expenditure. The tourism shock analysed is of a scale expected for the Commonwealth Games to be held in Glasgow in 2014.

D,Enhancement of the cytotoxic effect of anticancer agent by cytochrome C functionalised hybrid nanoparticles in hepatocellular cancer cells,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/enhancement-of-the-cytotoxic-effect-of-anticancer-agent-by-cytoch,"Treatment of hepatocellular cancer with chemotherapeutic agents has limited success in clinical practice and their efficient IC50 concentration would require extremely high doses of drug administration which could not be tolerated due to systemic side effects. In order to potentiate the efficacy of anticancer agents we explored the potential of co-treatment with pro-apoptotic Cytochrome c which activates the apoptotic pathway downstream of p53 that is frequently mutated in cancer. To this end we used hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles as a drug delivery system to facilitate the internalisation of Cytochrome c into cultured HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Our results showed that Cytochrome c can be easily conjugated to the gold shell of the nanoparticles which are readily taken up by the cells. We used Cytochrome c in concentration (0.2µgmL-1) below the threshold required to induce apoptosis on its own. When the conjugate was administered to cells treated by doxorubicin, it significantly reduced its IC50 concentration from 9µgmL-1 to 3.5µgmL-1 as detected by cell viability assay, and the efficiency of doxorubicin on decreasing viability of HepG2 cells was significantly enhanced in the lower concentration range between 0.01µgmL-1 to 5µgmL-1. The results demonstrate the potential of the application of therapeutic proteins in activating the apoptotic pathway to complement conventional chemotherapy to increase its efficacy. The application of hybrid iron oxide-gold nanoparticles can also augment the specificity of drug targeting and could serve as a model drug delivery system for pro-apoptotic protein targeting and delivery.",H & L,692
B,Optimising plans using genetic programming,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimising-plans-using-genetic-programming,"Finding the shortest plan for a given planning problem is extremely hard. We present a domain independent approach for plan optimisation based on Genetic Programming. The algorithm is seeded with correct plans created by hand-encoded heuristic policy sets. The plans are very unlikely to be optimal but are created quickly. The suboptimal plans are then evolved using a generational algorithm towards the optimal plan. We present initial results from Blocks World and found that GP method almost always improved sub-optimal plans, often drastically.",D,846
C,Time scale analysis of receptor enzyme activity: irreversible inhibition sometimes exhibits incubation-time independence,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/time-scale-analysis-of-receptor-enzyme-activity-irreversible-inhi,"At early drug discovery, purified protein-based assays are often used to characterise compound potency. As far as dose response is concerned, it is often thought that a time-independent inhibitor is reversible and a time-dependent inhibitor is irreversible. Using a simple kinetics model, we investigate the legitimacy of this. Our model-based analytical analysis and numerical studies reveal that dose response of an irreversible inhibitor may appear time-independent under certain parametric conditions. Hence, time-independence cannot be used as evidence for inhibitor reversibility. Furthermore, we also analysed how the synthesis and degradation of a target receptor affect drug inhibition in an in vitro cell-based assay setting. Indeed, these processes may also influence dose response of an irreversible inhibitor in such a way that it appears time-independent under certain conditions. Hence, time-independent dose response in a cell assay also needs careful considerations. It is necessary to formulate a suitable model for analysis of protein-based assay and in vitro cell assay data to ensure a consistent understanding.",C,105
E,Supporting exploratory video retrieval tasks with grouping and recommendation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/supporting-exploratory-video-retrieval-tasks-with-grouping-and-re,"In this paper, we present ViGOR (Video Grouping, Organisation and Recommendation), an exploratory video retrieval system. Exploratory video retrieval tasks are hampered by the lack of semantics associated to video and the overwhelming amount of video items stored in these types of collections (e.g. YouTube, MSN video, etc.). In order to help facilitate these exploratory video search tasks we present a system that utilises two complementary approaches: the first a new search paradigm that allows the semantic grouping of videos and the second the exploitation of past usage history in order to provide video recommendations. We present two types of recommendation techniques adapted to the grouping search paradigm: the first is a global recommendation, which couples the multi-faceted nature of explorative video retrieval tasks with the current user need of information in order to provide recommendations, and second is a local recommendation, which exploits the organisational features of ViGOR in order to provide more localised recommendations based on a specific aspect of the user task. Two user evaluations were carried out in order to (1) validate the new search paradigm provided by ViGOR, characterised by the grouping functionalities and (2) evaluate the usefulness of the proposed recommendation approaches when integrated into ViGOR. The results of our evaluations show (1) that the grouping, organisational and recommendation functionalities can result in an improvement in the users’ search performance without adversely impacting their perceptions of the system and (2) that both recommendation approaches are relevant to the users at different stages of their search, showing the importance of using multi-faceted recommendations for video retrieval systems and also illustrating the many uses of collaborative recommendations for exploratory video search tasks.",B & E,158

Longitudinal birth cohort study in northeast England, cross-sectional analysis.  Participants 425 children (41% of the original cohort) aged 6–8 years (49% boys).  Main outcome measures PA over 7 days was measured objectively by an accelerometer; three categories of PA were created: ‘active’ ≥60 min/day moderate-to-vigorous-intensity PA (MVPA); ‘moderately active’ 30–59 min/day MVPA; ‘inactive’ <30 min/day MVPA. Dietary intake over 4 days was measured using a prospective dietary assessment tool which incorporated elements of the food diary and food frequency methods. Three diet categories were created: ‘healthy’, ‘unhealthy’ and ‘mixed’, according to the number of portions of different foods consumed. Adherence to the ‘5-a-day’ recommendations for portions of fruit and vegetables was also assessed. Children were classified as ‘healthy weight’ or ‘overweight or obese’ (OW/OB) according to International Obesity Taskforce cutpoints for BMI. Associations between weight status and PA/diet categories were analysed using logistic regression.  Few children met the UK-recommended guidelines for either MVPA or fruit and vegetable intake, with just 7% meeting the recommended amount of MVPA of 60 min/day, and 3% meeting the 5-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendation. Higher PA was associated with a lower OR for OW/OB in boys only (0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.88). There was no association detected between dietary intake and OW/OB in either sex.  Increasing MVPA may help to reduce OW/OB in boys; however, more research is required to examine this relationship in girls. Children are not meeting the UK guidelines for diet and PA, and more needs to be done to improve this situation.",E & F,790
B,High speed differential protection for smart DC distribution systems,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/high-speed-differential-protection-for-smart-dc-distribution-syst,This paper presents a high speed current differential implementation approach for smart dc distribution systems capable of sub-millisecond fault detection. The approach utilizes the natural characteristics of dc differential current measurements to significantly reduce fault detection times compared to standard applications and hence meet requirements for dc converter protection (around 2ms). Analysis is first developed to help quantify protection implementation challenges for a given dc system. Options for implementing the proposed technique are then illustrated. Results of scaled hardware testing are presented which validate the overall protection operating times in a low voltage environment. These results show the implementation approach can consistently achieve protection system operating within the order of a few microseconds.,F & K,108

We show that the entanglement between excitations of two Bose-Einstein condensates is degraded after one of them undergoes a change in the gravitational field strength. This prediction can be tested if the condensates are initially entangled in two separate satellites while being in the same orbit and then one of them moves to a different orbit. We show that the effect is observable in a typical orbital manoeuvre of nanosatellites like CanX4 and CanX5.,D,701

The paper follows a case study approach showing how theory has been put into practice. The case study was executed in a leading automotive company based in India.
The application of the Six Sigma methodology resulted in a reduction of tolerance-related problems and improved the first pass yield from 85 to over 99 per cent. A number of tools and techniques in the Six Sigma tool box have been utilised for data analysis and drawing valid and sound conclusions. The implementation of the Six Sigma methodology has demonstrated a saving of US$70,000 in addition to the customer-facing benefits of improved quality on returns and sales.
The results of the case study have provided greater stimulus within the production facilities for wider application of the methodology as a powerful problem solving methodology. Moreover, this case study sets the foundation for many other projects within the business.

This article analyses the effects of EU pre-accession programmes on the development of national-level structures for the coordination of EU funds in Croatia. The article is based on an in-depth case study of the Croatian coordination structures for EU funding, using a three-step analytical framework of adaptation. The empirical research focuses on the role and influence of the Croatian Central State Office for Development Strategy and Coordination of EU Funds (CODEF). The main finding was that preaccession assistance played a decisive role in the establishment and early support of national coordination structures. However, holistic reform in the state sector was not achieved and the new institutions were often challenged by domestic opposition structures. The research provides useful insights for the literature on Europeanization in accession countries, and for EU pre-accession policy.",B & E,318
A,Just telling and selling: current limitations in the use of digital media in public health: A scoping review,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/just-telling-and-selling-current-limitations-in-the-use-of-digita,"Objective - To undertake a scoping review and to map research in the area of digital media use in public health.

Study design - Scoping review.

Methods - PubMed, PsycINFO, Google and major textbooks of public health communication and health psychology were searched for primary studies or systematic reviews examining the use of digital media in a health context. Searches focussed on studies published between the start of 2000 and the end of June 2013. Abstracts of reviews of public health interventions were examined with respect to target groups, health topic, intervention characteristics, media used, study design, issues of quality and ethics, and outcomes. To map this area of work fully, this information was supplemented by adding information from primary studies. Areas were identified where systematic review evidence was scarce or non-existent by comparing the final map with information from the reviews analysed.

Results - 221 systematic reviews related to digital media use in a public health context were included. Most reviews included studies with an experimental design and general ‘at risk’ target populations. Specific settings were not specified in the majority of reviews. A large variety of health topics were covered. About a quarter of reviews did not specify a health topic but were concerned with broader issues of health promotion, disease prevention, or health education. Over half of the reviews focussed on eHealth and telemedicine, and another third were concerned with mass media – social marketing. Reviews most frequently reported behaviour-related outcomes or conducted some form of content analysis or analysis of the use of particular media. Research gaps were identified relating to community-based research, participation and empowerment, active media use (especially with respect to visual media und use of specific visual methodologies), and the use of salutogenic or assets-based approaches.

Conclusion - The available research relating to digital media use in public health is dominated by studies relating to eHealth, telehealth or social marketing; emphasising the passive reception of messages and a focus on individual behaviour change approaches. Issues of quality and ethics need to be taken into account more consistently. Further research is needed with respect to more participatory methods, particularly those which would seek to use digital media as a means to harness individual and community assets.",E & F,244

We developed and tested a model that associates team collectivism as the antecedent of within-team competition, and knowledge sharing and team flexibility as the outcomes. The model was empirically tested with data from 141 knowledge-intensive teams. The empirical findings showed that team collectivism had a positive relationship with team development competition and a negative relationship with team hypercompetition. Regarding the outcomes, team development competition and team hypercompetition had an indirect relationship with knowledge sharing and team flexibility through team empowerment. We offer a number of original contributions to the team effectiveness literature, especially by showing that team hypercompetition and team development competition have different impacts on team knowledge sharing and team flexibility.",M & I,456

C,The economics of distributed energy generation: a literature review,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-economics-of-distributed-energy-generation-a-literature-revie,"The UK electricity system is likely to face dramatic technical and institutional changes in the near future.  Current UK energy policy focuses on the need for a clean, affordable and secure energy supply. Decentralisation of the electricity system is recognised as one means of achieving efficient and renewable energy provision, as well as addressing concerns over ageing electricity infrastructure and capacity constraints.    In this paper we provide a critical literature review of the economics of increased penetration of distributed energy generation.  We find that there exists a large volume of research considering the financial viability of individual distributed generation technologies (and we are necessarily selective in our review of these studies, given the wide variety of technologies that the definition of distributed generation encompasses).  However, there are few studies that focus on the pure economics of individual or groups of distributed energy generators, and even fewer still based on the economy-wide aspects of distributed generation.  In view of this gap in the literature, we provide suggestions for future research which are likely to be necessary in order adequately to inform public policy on distributed generation and its role in the future of UK energy supply.",E & A,827
A,Th1 immune responses can be modulated by varying dimethyldioctadecylammonium and distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine content in liposomal adjuvants,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/th1-immune-responses-can-be-modulated-by-varying-dimethyldioctade,"OBJECTIVES: Cationic liposomes of dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDA) combined with trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (TDB) elicit strong cell-mediated and antibody immune responses; DDA facilitates antigen adsorption and presentation while TDB potentiates the immune response. To further investigate the role of DDA, DDA was replaced with the neutral lipid of distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC) over a series of concentrations and these systems investigated as adjuvants for the delivery of Ag85B-ESAT-6-Rv2660c, a multistage tuberculosis vaccine.METHODS: Liposomal were prepared at a 5 : 1 DDA-TDB weight ratio and DDA content incrementally replaced with DSPC. The physicochemical characteristics were assessed (vesicle size, zeta potential and antigen loading), and the ability of these systems to act as adjuvants was considered.KEY FINDINGS: As DDA was replaced with DSPC within the liposomal formulation, the cationic nature of the vesicles decreases as does electrostatically binding of the anionic H56 antigen (Hybrid56; Ag85B-ESAT6-Rv2660c); however, only when DDA was completed replaced with DSPC did vesicle size increase significantly. T-helper 1 (Th1)-type cell-mediated immune responses reduced. This reduction in responses was attributed to the replacement of DDA with DSPC rather than the reduction in DDA dose concentration within the formulation.CONCLUSION: These results suggest Th1 responses can be controlled by tailoring the DDA/DSPC ratio within the liposomal adjuvant system.",A & G,405
D,Conformations and effective interactions of polymer coated nanoparticles at liquid interfaces,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/conformations-and-effective-interactions-of-polymer-coated-nanopa,"We investigate conformations and effective interactions of polymer-coated nanopar- ticles adsorbed at a model liquid-liquid interface via molecular dynamics simulations. The polymer shells strongly deform at the interface, with the shape governed by a balance between maximising the decrease in interfacial area between the two solvent components, minimising unfavourable contact between polymer and solvent and max- imising the conformational entropy of the polymers. Using potential of mean force calculations we compute the effective interaction between the nanoparticles at the liquid-liquid interface. We find that it differs quantitatively from the bulk and is sig- nificantly affected by the length of the polymer chains and by the solvent quality. Under good solvent conditions the effective interactions are always repulsive and soft for long chains. The repulsion range decreases as the solvent quality decreases. In particular, under poor solvent conditions, short chains may fail to induce steric repul- sion, leading to a net attraction between the nanoparticles, whereas with long enough chains the effective interaction potential may feature an additional repulsive shoulder at intermediate distances.",H & L,932
B,Laser pulse propagation and enhanced energy coupling to fast electrons in dense plasma gradients,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/laser-pulse-propagation-and-enhanced-energy-coupling-to-fast-elec,"Laser energy absorption to fast electrons during the interaction of an ultra-intense (1020 W/cm2), picosecond laser pulse with a solid is investigated, experimentally and numerically, as a function of the plasma density scale length at the irradiated surface. It is shown that there is an optimum density gradient for efficient energy coupling to electrons and that this arises due to strong self-focusing and channeling driving energy absorption over an extended length in the preformed plasma. At longer density gradients the laser laments, resulting in significantly lower overall energy coupling. As the scale length is further increased, a transition to a second laser energy absorption process is observed experimentally via multiple diagnostics. The results demonstrate that it is possible to significantly enhance laser energy absorption and coupling to fast electrons by dynamically controlling the plasma density gradient.",D,599
C,Parallel centerline extraction on the GPU,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/parallel-centerline-extraction-on-the-gpu,"Centerline extraction is important in a variety of visualization applications including shape analysis, geometry processing, and virtual endoscopy. Centerlines allow accurate measurements of length along winding tubular structures, assist automatic virtual navigation, and provide a path-planning system to control the movement and orientation of a virtual camera.

However, efficiently computing centerlines with the desired accuracy has been a major challenge. Existing centerline methods are either not fast enough or not accurate enough for interactive application to complex 3D shapes. Some methods based on distance mapping are accurate, but these are sequential algorithms which have limited performance when running on the CPU. To our knowledge, there is no accurate parallel centerline algorithm that can take advantage of modern many-core parallel computing resources, such as GPUs, to perform automatic centerline extraction from large data volumes at interactive speed and with high accuracy.

In this paper, we present a new parallel centerline extraction algorithm suitable for implementation on a GPU to produce highly accurate, 26-connected, one-voxel-thick centerlines at interactive speed. The resulting centerlines are as accurate as those produced by a state-of-the-art sequential CPU method [40], while being computed hundreds of times faster. Applications to fly through path planning and virtual endoscopy are discussed. Experimental results demonstrating centeredness, robustness and efficiency are presented.",C,320

In this study, the aim was to investigate the role of cholesterol in cationic liposomal adjuvant system based on dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) and trehalose 6,6'-dibehenate (TDB) which has been shown as a strong adjuvant system for vaccines against a wide range of diseases. Packaging of cholesterol within DDA:TDB liposomes was investigated using differential scanning calorimetery and surface pressure-area isotherms of lipid monolayers; incorporation of cholesterol into liposomal membranes promoted the formation of a liquid-condensed monolayer and removed the main phase transition temperature of the system, resulting in an increased bilayer fluidity and reduced antigen retention in vitro. In vivo biodistribution studies found that this increase in membrane fluidity did not alter deposition of liposomes and antigen at the site of injection. In terms of immune responses, early (12 days after immunization) IgG responses were reduced by inclusion of cholesterol; thereafter there were no differences in antibody (IgG, IgG1, IgG2b) responses promoted by DDA:TDB liposomes with and without cholesterol. However, significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma were induced by DDA:TDB liposomes, and liposome uptake by macrophages in vitro was also shown to be higher for DDA:TDB liposomes compared to their cholesterol-containing counterparts, suggesting that small changes in bilayer mechanics can impact both cellular interactions and immune responses.",F & K,140
C,Development of a readability index attuned to the new English Course of Study in Japan,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/development-of-a-readability-index-attuned-to-the-new-english-cou,"For several years, we have been engaged in evaluating techniques for estimating readability. Arising from this work, there have been several iterations of readability indices attuned to the English textbooks employed in Japanese high schools for the English Course of Study. In this paper, we briefly review approaches to readability measurement before detailing our project that aims to develop new readability indices that are attuned to the new English teaching system of Japan. Our earlier approach to the Japanese English teaching context employed regression analysis to develop a linear measure in which sentence length, word length, word difficulty and idiom difficulty are independent  variables and the textbook year of passages is a dependent variable. This linear function (Diff) proved to be broadly effective as a guide to reading level for English texts in the Japanese school context and was released for use as 'the Ozasa-Fukui Year Level'. From 2012, changes to the English Course of Study in Japan made it necessary to update this English readability index. To this end, our earlier approach was enhanced to provide a non-linear formula in which an experts’ readability judgement of English sentences is employed as a dependent variable and combined with the previously developed linear function (Diff) as an independent variable. The resultant computation yielded a non-linear function expression: NewDiff = a/(1+b*exp(-c*Diff))+0.9 in which we have the following component values:
a=3.8593, b=766.9372, c=2.5709, Diff = 0.0863*Words/S + 0.2943*Syllables/W + 0.6332*WordDiff/W + 0.0665*IdiomDiff/S + 0.5366. Applying this new measure, we determined that the coefficient of determination for this new formula (r^2) was 0.8236. Thereby, indicating a high degree of fit to the target data.",M & I,259

This raises an obvious question as to how to restrict malicious parties from making use of excessive network resources, in order to ensure the storage capacity of the network is not quickly depleted by a small number of users making excessive use of storage. Such activity risks preventing legitimate use of the network. This paper explores two possible means of secure storage quota management on such a decentralised network, and presents the concept of manager verification. It then presents a protocol-based solution to allow users to purchase extra storage from other users in a decentralised network, with irrepudiable and non-forgeable agreements, which are verifiable by any third party.",B & L,383

Cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]), cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and the linear cucurbituril-derivative Motor2 were examined for their neuro-, myo- and cardiotoxic activity and compared with β-cyclodextrin. The protective effect of drug encapsulation by CB[7] was also examined on the platinum-based anticancer drug cisplatin. The results show that none of the cucurbiturils have statistically measurable neurotoxicity as measured using mouse sciatic nerve compound action potential. Cucurbituril myotoxicity was measured by nerve-muscle force of contraction through chemical and electrical stimulation. Motor2 was found to display no myotoxicity, whereas both CB[6] and CB[7] showed myotoxic activity via a presynaptic effect. Finally, cardiotoxicity, which was measured by changes in the rate and force of right and left atria contraction, was observed for all three cucurbiturils. Free cisplatin displays neuro-, myo- and cardiotoxic activity, consistent with the side-effects seen in the clinic. Whilst CB[7] had no effect on the level of cisplatin's neurotoxic activity, drug encapsulation within the macrocycle had a marked reduction in both the drug's myo- and cardiotoxic activity. Overall the results are consistent with the relative lack of toxicity displayed by these macrocycles in whole animal acute systemic toxicity studies and indicate continued potential of cucurbiturils as drug delivery vehicles for the reduction of the side effects associated with platinum-based chemotherapy.",E & A,484
B,"The infant's creative vitality, in projects of self-discovery and shared meaning: how they anticipate school, and make it fruitful",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-infants-creative-vitality-in-projects-of-self-discovery-and-s,"This paper presents the child as a creature born with the spirit of an inquisitive and creative human being, seeking understanding of what to do with body and mind in a world of invented possibilities. He or she is intuitively sociable, seeking affectionate relations with companions who are willing to share the pleasure and adventure of doing and knowing with 'human sense'. Recent research traces signs of the child's impulses and feelings from before birth, and follows their efforts to master experience through stages of self-creating in enjoyable and hopeful companionship. Sensitive timing of rhythms in action and playful invention show age-related advances of creative vitality as the body and brain grow. Much of shared meaning is understood and played with before a child can benefit from school instruction in a prescribed curriculum of the proper ways to use elaborate symbolic conventions. We begin with the theory of James Mark Baldwin, who observed that infants and young children are instinctive experimenters, repeating experience by imitating their own as well as other's actions, accommodating to the resources of the shared world and assimilating new experiences as learned ideas for action. We develop a theory of the child's contribution to cultural learning that may be used to guide practice in early education and care of children in their families and communities and in artificially planned and technically structured modern worlds of bewildering diversity.",A & G,997
C,Islamic heritage marketing: the Umrah experience,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/islamic-heritage-marketing-the-umrah-experience,"A potential visitor’s image of a destination and its attributes is likely to influence their behaviour before, during, and after their trip. However, there is a lack of research into Islamic destination image (Jafari & Scott, 2013; Stephenson, 2014). Existing studies have commented on the differentiation between the expectation formation of Muslim and non-Muslim tourists; however these are often restricted to more secular destinations such as Turkey. Moreover, much of the literature which focuses solely on the Muslim community fails to explore beyond the realms of religious satisfaction of their experiences. This paper explores the journey of experience of Muslim pilgrims during the Islamic pilgrimage to the Umrah. Globally, the Hajj is one of the greatest traveller movements, demonstrating a significant rationale for the study of Islam within the heritage tourism domain. Islamic texts, such as the Quran, endorse traveling with a view to attaining social, physical and spiritual objectives. As such, tourism of various categories is compatible with Islam and inspired by its principles. However, the Hajj and Umrah is a highly commanded activity encompassing devout and monetary planning. Therefore, for some Muslims Hajj is a sacred obligation rather than form of heritage tourism. With this in mind, religious pilgrimage is likely to have a very strong destination image in the minds of Muslim visitors. Therefore, this paper looks not only at sacred obligation but also attitudes such as hedonic value, motivations, socialisation, gift, and evidence. Therefore, our study contributes to a wider understanding of the perceptions and behavioural outcomes of visitors toward Islamic destination image. To do so, we develop a conceptual model based i=on the theory of the ‘commodity fetishism’. The term ‘commodity fetishism’ refers to the system through which capitalist societies treat ‘commodities as if value inhered in the objects themselves, rather than in the amount of real labour expended to produce the object’. Thus, this paper attempts to address two gaps, firstly examining the symbolic importance to pilgrims of material objects of pilgrimage, and secondly examining this symbolic experience in the Islamic context of Umrah. Our survey data was collected in a number of tourists agents within Iran from Muslim pilgrims preceding their visit to the Umrah and returning home. Structural equation modelling is tested with a sample of 538 visitors. The empirical validation of the conceptual model supports a majority of the research hypotheses. These findings contribute to a better understanding of Islamic destination image in the heritage tourism context and a series of implications are proposed.",H & L,159
D,Optimal design of water distribution systems based on entropy and topology,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimal-design-of-water-distribution-systems-based-on-entropy-and,"A new multi-objective evolutionary optimization approach for joint topology and pipe size design of water distribution systems is presented. The algorithm proposed considers simultaneously the adequacy of flow and pressure at the demand nodes; the initial construction cost; the network topology; and a measure of hydraulic capacity reliability. The optimization procedure is based on a general measure of hydraulic performance that combines statistical entropy, network connectivity and hydraulic feasibility. The topological properties of the solutions are accounted for and arbitrary assumptions regarding the quality of infeasible solutions are not applied. In other words, both feasible and infeasible solutions participate in the evolutionary processes; solutions survive and reproduce or perish strictly according to their Pareto-optimality. Removing artificial barriers in this way frees the algorithm to evolve optimal solutions quickly. Furthermore, any redundant binary codes that result from crossover or mutation are eliminated gradually in a seamless and generic way that avoids the arbitrary loss of potentially useful genetic material and preserves the quality of the information that is transmitted from one generation to the next. The approach proposed is entirely generic: we have not introduced any additional parameters that require calibration on a case-by-case basis. Detailed and extensive results for two test problems are included that suggest the approach is highly effective. In general, the frontier-optimal solutions achieved include topologies that are fully branched, partially- and fully-looped and, for networks with multiple sources, completely separate sub-networks.",D,958

One of the steroids possesses an unusually short hydrocarbon side chain. The structures were elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and confirmed using electron impact- and high resolution electrospray-mass spectrometry.

Consideration is given to Non-Keplerian orbits, where it is found that the orbit altitudes are restrictively high, and traditional highly-elliptical Molniya orbits where it is found that no single spacecraft can provide observations „over the pole‟ to 55 degrees latitude of equal quality to those produced by geostationary systems. Subsequent analysis of the Taranis concept reveals the ability of these systems to adequately view the target region with a reduction in the required number of spacecraft. Mass budget analysis reveals a possible payload mass of 151 – 379 kg for a single platform launched using the Soyuz launcher to a 16 hour, 90 degree inclination Taranis orbit for an 8.5 year mission. Four spacecraft, capable of observing continuously to 55 degrees latitude using single imagery, can be launched on the Ariane 5, which results in a payload mass range of 193 – 482 kg for an 8.5 year mission.",B & E,155
A,Optimal sampling plan for clean development mechanism lighting projects with lamp population decay,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimal-sampling-plan-for-clean-development-mechanism-lighting-pr,"This paper proposes a metering cost minimisation model that minimises metering cost under the constraints of sampling accuracy requirement for clean development mechanism (CDM) energy efficiency (EE) lighting project. Usually small scale (SSC) CDM EE lighting projects expect a crediting period of 10 years given that the lighting population will decay as time goes by. The SSC CDM sampling guideline requires that the monitored key parameters for the carbon emission reduction quantification must satisfy the sampling accuracy of 90% confidence and 10% precision, known as the 90/10 criterion. For the existing registered CDM lighting projects, sample sizes are either decided by professional judgment or by rule-of-thumb without considering any optimisation. Lighting samples are randomly selected and their energy consumptions are monitored continuously by power meters. In this study, the sampling size determination problem is formulated as a metering cost minimisation model by incorporating a linear lighting decay model as given by the CDM guideline AMS-II.J. The 90/10 criterion is formulated as constraints to the metering cost minimisation problem. Optimal solutions to the problem minimise the metering cost whilst satisfying the 90/10 criterion for each reporting period. The proposed metering cost minimisation model is applicable to other CDM lighting projects with different population decay characteristics as well.",E & F,226

The challenge of evaluating the performance of such schemes is massive since practical deployments are costly and hence flexible software evaluation/development environments become an attractive alternative. This paper details a versatile Distributed Demand Side Management Integrated Development Environment with multi-agent support (DDSM-IDEA), a platform to develop, execute, and evaluate the performance of various agentless and agent-based DSM and DDSM algorithms offering a spectrum of different resources, agents, and tools bundled into one package. The IDE platform includes a robust habitual demand profile generation module based on personal activity profiles, manual and automatic appliance control, and instantaneous demand disaggregation which in addition to its other capabilities and resources, makes it a more complete solution. The DDSM-IDEA is tested and several DSM and DDSM strategies are implemented and evaluated.",F & K,808

This article shares findings from a project that aimed to gauge the knowledge of human rights education of students undertaking initial teacher education and childhood practice programmes at one university in Scotland. Students were invited to share their experiences of and attitudes towards human rights education. While some students were confident in their approach to human rights education, others identified barriers, including their own knowledge and the structures acting upon them as teachers. Initial conclusions suggest that education students feel ill-equipped to engage with human rights education and that this issue must be addressed in initial teacher education courses.",M & I,502

Under ambient pressure only one polymorph of the title compound was isolated but when subjected to high pressure a further two polymorphs are observed. The phase transitions at >0.5 GPa and >3.6 GPa are reversible single crystal to single crystal transitions which is possible due to the similarity of the packing in the molecules. It is proposed that these transitions are driven by the pV term of the Gibbs Free Energy equation rather than by the relief of repulsive interactions between molecules.,E & A,420
A,Optimized Schwarz methods for curl-curl time-harmonic Maxwell's equations,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimized-schwarz-methods-for-curl-curl-time-harmonic-maxwells-eq,"Like the Helmholtz equation, the high frequency time-harmonic Maxwell's equations are difficult to solve by classical iterative methods. Domain decomposition methods are currently most promising: following the first provably convergent method in [4], various optimized Schwarz methods were developed over the last decade [1–3, 5, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16]. There are however two basic formulations for Maxwell’s equation: the first order formulation, for which complete optimized results are known [5], and the second order, or curl-curl formulation, with partial optimization results [1, 13, 16]. We show in this paper that the convergence factors and the optimization process for the two formulations are the same. We then show by numerical experiments that the Fourier analysis predicts very well the behavior of the algorithms for a Yee scheme discretization, which corresponds to Nedelec edge elements on a tensor product mesh, in the curl-curl formulation. When using however mixed type Nedelec elements on an irregular tetrahedral mesh, numerical experiments indicate that transverse magnetic (TM) modes are less well resolved for high frequencies than transverse electric (TE) modes, and a heuristic can then be used to compensate for this in the optimization.",A & G,695

Since the first human intervention more than 10 years ago, over 50 different types of valves have been developed. The CoreValve and Edwards SAPIEN valves have both experienced clinical trials and the latter has gained FDA approval for implantation in patients considered inoperable. Current complications, such as major vascular bleeding and stroke, prevent these valves from being commonly deployed in patients considered operable in conventional surgery. This review focuses on the past and present achievements of these valves and highlights the design considerations required to progress development further. It is envisaged that, with continued improvement in valve design and with increased clinical and engineering experience, percutaneous heart valve replacement may one day be a viable option for lower-risk operable patients.",H & L,834

C,Ongoing initiatives to improve prescribing efficiency in China: statins as a case history,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/ongoing-initiatives-to-improve-prescribing-efficiency-in-china-st,"Pharmaceutical expenditure rose by 16% per annum in China during the past decade, and now represents 46% of total healthcare expenditure. Initiatives to moderate growth include pricing regulations for pharmaceuticals and encouraging International Nonproprietary Name (INN) prescribing. However, there is limited monitoring of physician prescribing and current incentives encourage hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement.  The objective was to assess changes in statin utilization and expenditure as additional generics are launched. Subsequently, compare results in China with findings among European countries to provide future guidance.  We used observational retrospective study of statin utilization and procurement expenditure from 2004 to 2013 in two large teaching hospital groups.  The results were that statin utilization rose 32-fold in one hospital group and 54-fold in the other. Expenditure also increased but to a lesser extent, i.e. from just over Renminbi ‘yuan’ (CNY) 0.65 million in 2004 to CNY 15.3 million in 2013 in one hospital group and from CNY 0.49 to CNY 19.3 million in the other. Atorvastatin (originator) was the most utilized statin. Utilization of each generic statin was typically low, e.g. 10% in 2013 in one hospital group. Procurement prices fell over time, greatest for generic simvastatin (-74% to -91%) mirroring data from European countries. However, no increase in their prescribing was observed. In fact, a significant decrease in generic prescribing was seen in one hospital group between 2004 and 2013.  There are considerable opportunities to improve prescribing efficiency in China based on European experience. However, current incentives encouraging hospitals and physicians to profit from drug procurement need to be addressed.",C,510
E,A load sharing system reliability model with managed component degradation,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-load-sharing-system-reliability-model-with-managed-component-de,"Motivated by an industrial problem affecting a water utility, we develop a model for a load sharing system where an operator dispatches work load to components in a manner that manages their degradation. We assume degradation is the dominant failure type, and that the system will not be subject to sudden failure due to a shock. By deriving the time to degradation failure of the system, estimates of system probability of failure are generated, and optimal designs can be obtained to minimize the long run average cost of a future system. The model can be used to support asset maintenance and design decisions. Our model is developed under a common set of core assumptions. That is, the operator allocates work to balance the level of the degradation condition of all components to achieve system performance. A system is assumed to be replaced when the cumulative work load reaches some random threshold. We adopt cumulative work load as the measure of total usage because it represents the primary cause of component degradation. We model the cumulative work load of the system as a monotone increasing and stationary stochastic process. The cumulative work load to degradation failure of a component is assumed to be inverse Gaussian distributed. An example, informed by an industry problem, is presented to illustrate the application of the model under different operating scenarios.",B & E,794

C,"Energetic, environmental and economic modelling of a solar-assisted residential micro-trigeneration system in a Mediterranean climate",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/energetic-environmental-and-economic-modelling-of-a-solar-assiste,"Reducing energy consumption in buildings has become a priority for most countries. However, designing energy-efficient buildings is not a straightforward task - the increasing demand for high comfort standards, provided by conventional 'energy-hungry' cooling and heating devices conflicts with the need for demand reduction. Trigeneration, the simultaneous production of electricity, cooling and heating is often viewed as a means of improving energy-efficiency in large and medium sized buildings whilst still delivering thermal comfort. For hot climates, the benefit of utilising the waste heat emitted from an engine unit to power a thermally driven cooling device provides scope to utilise an otherwise wasted energy stream. However, in smaller sized residential buildings, the relatively low and intermittent energy demand coupled with high capital costs, has stifled the uptake of the technology - although the potential for substantial energy savings exists. Moreover, it is very common for home owners in hot climates to opt for other energy-saving devices such as solar water heaters (SWH), which would tend to reduce further the possible demand for space and water heating, possibly making the simultaneous use of both micro-trigeneration and SWH unfeasible. This paper compares the performance of a residential micro-trigeneration system to a hybrid micro-trigeneration/SWH system. The performance of both systems was simulated using a whole building simulation tool run at a high time resolution. The results obtained were then used to quantify the energetic and environmental performance of both systems; and also to assess their financial viability against the effect of varying fuel prices, electricity tariffs and a varying Feed-in Tariff (FIT). Results show that whereas the solar aided micro-trigeneration system obtains an overall higher (though marginal) energetic and environmental performance, the financial performance for the same fiscal parameters (fuel prices and electricity tariffs) deteriorates. Moreover FIT, plays an important role in the financial feasibility of the system.",M & I,115
E,Accurate position tracking of optically trapped live cells,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/accurate-position-tracking-of-optically-trapped-live-cells,"Optical trapping is a powerful tool in Life Science research and is becoming common place in many microscopy laboratories and facilities. There is a growing need to directly trap the cells of interest rather than introduce beads to the sample that can affect the fundamental biological functions of the sample and impact on the very properties the user wishes to observe and measure. However, instabilities while tracking large inhomogeneous objects, such as cells, can make tracking position, calibrating trap strength and making reliable measurements challenging. These instabilities often manifest themselves as cell roll or re-orientation and can occur as a result of viscous drag forces and thermal convection, as well as spontaneously due to Brownian forces. In this paper we discuss and mathematically model the cause of this roll and present several experimental approaches for tackling these issues, including using a novel beam profile consisting of three closely spaced traps and tracking a trapped object by analysing fluorescence images. The approaches presented here trap T cells which form part of the adaptive immune response system, but in principle can be applied to a wide range of samples where the size and inhomogeneous nature of the trapped object can hinder particle tracking experiments.",B & L,517
A,Using an epidemiological model to investigate unwarranted variation: the case of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion in England,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/using-an-epidemiological-model-to-investigate-unwarranted-variati,"Objectives: To investigate unwarranted variation in ventilation tube insertions for otitis media with effusion in children in England. This procedure is known to be 'overused' from clinical audits, as only one in three ventilation tube insertions conforms to the appropriateness criteria of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE); but audits cannot identify the scale of 'underuse' - i.e. patients who would benefit but are not treated.
Methods:
To explore both 'underuse' and 'overuse' of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion, we developed an epidemiological model based on: definitions of children with otitis media with effusion expected to benefit from ventilation tubes according to NICE guidance; epidemiological and clinical information from a systematic review; and expert judgement. A range of estimates was derived using Monte Carlo simulation and compared with the number of ventilation tubes provided in the English National Health Service in 2010.
Results:
About 32,200 children in England would be expected to benefit from ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion per year (between 20,411 and 45,231 with 90% certainty). The observed number of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion-associated diagnoses was 16,824.
Conclusions:
The expected population capacity to benefit from ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion based on NICE guidance appeared to exceed, by far, the number of ventilation tubes provided in the English National Health Service. So, while there is known 'overuse', there also may be substantial 'underuse' of ventilation tubes for otitis media with effusion if NICE criteria were applied. Future investigations of unwarranted variation should, therefore, not only focus on the patients who are treated but also consider the potential for benefit at the population level.",E & A,335
B,Impact assessment of Scottish independence on the space sector,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/impact-assessment-of-scottish-independence-on-the-space-sector,"This politically neutral work explores the impact of independence on Scotland’s emerging, innovative and world leading civilian space sector. The ecosystem is explained and quantified, clarifying the distinction between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Union, which the White Paper, Scotland’s Future, has blurred. Aspects of the White Paper relating to the sector are highlighted and discussed. The proposed relationship between an independent  Scotland (iScotland) and the UK Space Agency (UKSA) is unclear within the White Paper. As the spirit adopted in the White Paper is wherever possible to continue co-operation with existing UK bodies this scenario is considered, with membership of ESA via UKSA, alongside direct membership of ESA. Scottish independence could be said to be worth £15 – 20 million per year to the sector in the medium-term, and the long-term size and scale of the sector may be of order £100 million; almost triple the current size. However, this is dependent on the relationship established between iScotland and the rest-of-the-UK (rUK), and appears to require a contravention of the spirit of the White Paper. How iScotland chooses to maintain a formal relationship with UKSA is thus of vital importance, having both economic and legal implications. Seeking a continuing relationship would require agreement about delegation of ministerial power, sovereign funds and indemnity provisions in response to any government liability for damage. As regards membership of ESA and EUMETSAT in particular, the existing member states are required to agree to accession by iScotland and to set the conditions; any disruption or lack of access to international organisations, including the EU, could be a potentially significant problem. Post-independence, the scope of UK nationality, as opposed to citizenship, would also require clarification in the context of space and any on-going relationship with UKSA.

The relationship with EUMETSAT via co-funding contributions to the Met Office requires further thought but does appear in principle to be a viable option. The same judgement of ‘viable’ can be reached when considering the Scottish government’s proposals around the Research Councils. However, whilst an approach may be viable, no assessment or judgement is offered as to its desirability from either an iScottish or rUK perspective.",A & G,811

B,Determinants of European national men’s football team performance: Scotland's potential progress in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/determinants-of-european-national-mens-football-team-performance-,"In this paper, we estimate the potential outcomes for Scotland in the 2016 Euro qualifiers, based on a model of the outcomes of previous European men's football matches. The sampled dataset includes all matches played between European national men’s football teams between August 2012 and December 2013, that is 368 matches in all. According to our model, Scotland should fail to progress to the UEFA Euro 2016 playoffs by only one goal in Group D. This result is confirmed when we correct our model to take into account the difference between real scores and scores provided by the model for each team in Group D. Nevertheless, in a third model – which is a better predictor – Scotland should come third in Group D and thus proceed to the playoffs in which it could hope to qualify for the Euro 2016 Finals. A fourth and final approach predicts that Scotland could even come second in Group D, behind Germany, and thus qualify directly to the UEFA Euro 2016 Finals in France.",F & K,858

D,"Seasonal and spatial patterns of picophytoplankton growth, grazing and distribution in the East China Sea",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/seasonal-and-spatial-patterns-of-picophytoplankton-growth-grazing,"Dynamics of picophytoplankton population distribution in the East China Sea (ECS), a marginal sea in the western North Pacific Ocean, were studied during two cruises in August 2009 (summer) and January 2010 (winter). Dilution experiments were conducted during the two cruises to investigate the growth and grazing among picophytoplantkon populations. Comparisons of phytoplankton growth (μ0) and microzooplankton grazing rates (m) on seasonal (summer and winter), spatial (plume, transitional and Kuroshio regions) and vertical (surface and depth of chlorophyll maximum) scales were made. The three picophytoplankton populations occupied different ecological niches and showed different distribution patterns (especially in summer), which is, however, not coincident with their maximum growth rate. The distribution and population transition of picophytoplankton is therefore a result of the balance between growth and grazing mortality. Average growth rates (μ0) for Prochlorococcus (Pro), Synechococcus (Syn) and picoeukaryotes (Peuk) were 0.36, 0.81 and 0.90 d−1 in summer, and 0.46, 0.58 and 0.56 d−1 in winter, respectively. Average grazing mortality rates (m) were 0.46, 0.63 and 0.68 d−1 in summer, and 0.25, 0.22 and 0.23 d−1 in winter for Pro, Syn and Peuk, respectively. The spatial pattern of both growth and grazing mortality rates showed decreasing trends from the inshore to offshore region, indicating a strong influence of the nutrient gradient induced by Yangtze River input. In summer, Pro, Syn and Peuk were dominant in Kuroshio, transitional and plume regions, respectively, while in winter all the three populations tended to thrive in the offshore regions, particularly for Pro and Syn. Vertically, picophytoplankton exhibited the highest abundance at ~ 20 m in summer and at the surface in winter. Both growth rate and grazing mortality were higher at the surface than in the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM) layer. On average, protist grazing consumed 84, 79 and 74% and 45, 47 and 57% of production for Pro, Syn and Peuk in summer and winter, respectively.",B & L,407
C,"Enhanced inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes by exposure to 405 nm light under sub-lethal temperature, salt and acid stress conditions",https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/enhanced-inactivation-of-escherichia-coli-and-listeria-monocytoge,"The antimicrobial effects of 405 nm light have generated interest in its use as an emerging disinfection technology with potential food-related applications. The aim of this study was to assess the bactericidal efficacy of 405 nm light for inactivation of Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes under sub-lethally stressed environmental conditions. Bacteria were exposed to 405 nm light from a light emitting diode (LED) array under various temperature, salt (NaCl) and acid conditions to determine if bacterial susceptibility to 405 nm light inactivation is affected when exposed under these conditions. Non-stressed bacterial populations (105 CFU/mL) were exposed to increasing doses of 405 nm light (~ 70 mW/cm2) and the inactivation results were compared with those generated under stress conditions. Bacteria were held at various temperatures (4 °C, 22 °C and 45 °C), acid concentrations (pH 3, 3.5 and 7) and salt concentrations (0%, 0.8%, 10% and 15% NaCl), and simultaneously exposed to 405 nm light. Enhanced inactivation of both E. coli and L. monocytogenes was achieved when light exposure was combined with each of the sub-lethal stresses, with significantly increased inactivation rates compared to non-stressed populations (P ≤ 0.05). One exception was with L. monocytogenes when light-exposed in the presence of 15% salt, as this combination reduced bacterial inactivation. The greatest enhancement of 405 nm light inactivation for both bacterial species was achieved when light exposure was combined with sub-lethal acid stress conditions at pH 3. This was demonstrated by a 5-log10 reduction of E. coli following a 405 nm light dose of 84 J/cm2 compared to 378 J/cm2 for non-stressed populations (77% reduction in dose) and by a 5-log10 reduction of L. monocytogenes achieved with a dose of 42 J/cm2 which corresponded to 50% of the dose required for the equivalent reduction of non-stressed populations. This acid-enhanced 405 nm light inactivation effect was demonstrated with E. coli and L. monocytogenes when dispersed in liquid suspension and when deposited on a test surface. Overall, results from this study have shown that sub-lethally stressed bacteria have increased susceptibility to 405 nm light inactivation, thereby providing a synergistic inactivation effect, findings which increase the potential of this new light-based decontamination technology for food related applications.",E & A,402

This concept was proposed by Albyn Housing Association and the University of the Highlands and Islands, and accepted by the Digital Health & Care Institute as an Experience Lab, which took place in December 2014 in Inverness.The Experience Lab aimed to create a setting for stakeholders (service users, public sector, third sector and private businesses) to elicit issues around the deployment of a digital platform. Using Actor Network Mapping, the Lab focused on identifying existing practices and barriers of service provision, and exploring potential solutions for the digital brokering system.Several key findings emerged relating to the barriers faced by services users in relation to knowledge, accessibility and availability of services, which led to the identification of the opportunity for the software to function as a directory with high functionality offline as well as online. Additionally, the identification of unmet needs, service exchange and a skills bank represented how the software could have a role in connecting resources within communities. Findings included implications and recommendations regarding the responsibility of the moderator, the functionality and roll out of the software.",H & L,740
B,Optimal solar sail interplanetary heteroclinic transfers for novel space applications,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/optimal-solar-sail-interplanetary-heteroclinic-transfers-for-nove,"This paper investigates the design and optimization of solar sail interplanetary trajectories connecting both Libration Point Orbits (LPOs) and Distant Periodic Orbits (DPOs) belonging to different restricted three-body problems: namely the Sun-Earth model and the Sun-Venus one. Assuming the Sun always as first primary, the Earth and Venus are the second primary, and their relative models are coupled together with the view of defining heteroclinic connections. On suitable Poincare sections, solar sail sets are constructed to obtain transit conditions from LPOs of the departure dynamical system to either LPOs or DPOs of the arrival one. Starting from initial guesses that assume a constant attitude of the solar sail, an optimal control problem is formulated, encompassing a trade-off between minimum transfer time and minimum solar sail steering effort, and it is solved with a direct pseudospectral method. At the optimization stage, variable attitude solar sails are investigated, assuming spacecraft with different control capabilities.",D,451
C,Implementation of an F-statistic all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves in Virgo VSR1 data,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/implementation-of-an-f-statistic-all-sky-search-for-continuous-gr,"We present an implementation of the F-statistic to carry out the first search in data from the Virgo laser interferometric gravitational wave detector for periodic gravitational waves from a priori unknown, isolated rotating neutron stars. We searched a frequency f(0) range from 100 Hz to 1 kHz and the frequency dependent spindown f(1) range from -1.6(f(0)/100 Hz) x 10(-9) Hz s(-1) to zero. A large part of this frequency-spindown space was unexplored by any of the all-sky searches published so far. Our method consisted of a coherent search over two-day periods using the F-statistic, followed by a search for coincidences among the candidates from the two-day segments. We have introduced a number of novel techniques and algorithms that allow the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm in the coherent part of the search resulting in a fifty-fold speed-up in computation of the F-statistic with respect to the algorithm used in the other pipelines. No significant gravitational wave signal was found. The sensitivity of the search was estimated by injecting signals into the data. In the most sensitive parts of the detector band more than 90% of signals would have been detected with dimensionless gravitational-wave amplitude greater than 5 x 10(-24).",C,824

The study aims to contribute to the improvement of edge-aware techniques for smoothing an input image, while keeping its edges intact. The proposed HOR methods circumvent limitations of the existing state of the art methods, e.g., altering the image structure due to changes in contrast; remove artefacts around edges; as well as reducing computational complexity in terms of implementation and associated computational costs. In particular, the proposed method aims at reducing the changes in the image structure by intrinsically enclosing an edge-stop mechanism whose computational cost is comparable to the state-of-the-art multi-scale edge aware techniques.",E & F,283
B,Hydrodynamic coupling in microbially mediated fracture mineralization: formation of self-organized groundwater flow channels,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/hydrodynamic-coupling-in-microbially-mediated-fracture-mineraliza,"Evidence of fossilized microorganisms embedded within mineral veins and mineral-filled fractures has been observed in a wide range of geological environments. Microorganisms can act as sites for mineral nucleation and also contribute to mineral precipitation by inducing local geochemical changes. In this study, we explore fundamental controls on microbially induced mineralization in rock fractures. Specifically, we systematically investigate the influence of hydrodynamics (velocity, flow rate, aperture) on microbially mediated calcite precipitation. Our experimental results demonstrate that a feedback mechanism exists between the gradual reduction in fracture aperture due to precipitation, and its effect on the local fluid velocity. This feedback results in mineral fill distributions that focus flow into a small number of self-organizing channels that remain open, ultimately controlling the final aperture profile that governs flow within the fracture. This hydrodynamic coupling can explain field observations of discrete groundwater flow channeling within fracture-fill mineral geometries where strong evidence of microbial activity is reported.",F & K,820

While these efforts have value, they also raise significant conceptual and measurement issues. The paper discusses a series of these issues and considers strategies to further refine the categorization and detection of green sector enterprises. A new identification approach is put forward using search term combinations and text mining to discern green goods sector companies. This method is tested through a search of small and medium-size green goods enterprises in the UK.

E,Evidence for a role of executive functions in learning biology,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/evidence-for-a-role-of-executive-functions-in-learning-biology,"Research examining cognition and science learning has focused on working memory but evidence implicates a broader set of executive functions.  The current study examined executive functions and learning of biology in young adolescents. Fifty-six participants, aged 12-13 years, completed tasks of working memory (Spatial Working Memory), inhibition (Stop-Signal), attention set-shifting (ID/ED), and planning (Stockings of Cambridge), from the CANTAB. They also participated in a biology teaching session, practical and assessment on the topic of DNA designed specifically for the current study which measured a) memory for biology facts taught and b) understanding of information learned in the practical. Linear regression analysis revealed that planning ability predicted performance on the factual assessment and both spatial working memory and planning were predictive of performance on the conceptual assessment. The findings suggest that planning ability is important in learning biological facts but that a broader set of executive functions are important for conceptual learning, highlighting the role of executive functions in understanding and applying knowledge about what is learned within science teaching.",B & L,855
A,The Golgi S-acylation machinery comprises zDHHC enzymes with major differences in substrate affinity and S-acylation activity,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/the-golgi-s-acylation-machinery-comprises-zdhhc-enzymes-with-majo,"S-acylation, the attachment of fatty acids onto cysteine residues, regulates protein trafficking and function, and is mediated by a family of “zDHHC” enzymes. The S-acylation of peripheral membrane proteins has been proposed to occur at the Golgi, catalysed by an S-acylation “machinery” that displays little substrate specificity. To advance understanding of how S-acylation of peripheral membrane proteins is handled by Golgi zDHHC enzymes, we have investigated interactions between a subset of four Golgi zDHHC enzymes and two S-acylated proteins, SNAP25 and Cysteine-String Protein (CSP). Our results uncover major differences in substrate recognition and S-acylation by these zDHHC enzymes. The Ankyrin-repeat (ANK) domains of zDHHC17 and zDHHC13 mediated strong and selective interactions with SNAP25/CSP, whereas binding of zDHHC3 and zDHHC7 to these proteins was barely detectable. Despite this, zDHHC3/zDHHC7 could S-acylate SNAP25/CSP more efficiently than zDHHC17, whereas zDHHC13 lacked S-acylation activity toward these proteins. Overall, the results of this study support a model whereby dynamic intracellular localisation of peripheral membrane proteins is achieved by highly selective recruitment by a subset of zDHHC enzymes at the Golgi, combined with highly efficient S-acylation by other Golgi zDHHC-enzymes.",E & A,736

None of the lesions caused sensorimotor deficits that could affect locomotion. Lesions of the NAc-co, but not DMS or DLS, decreased unconditioned and conditioned freezing. The NAc-co and DLS lesioned rats learned the 2-way active avoidance task more slowly. These results suggest: (i) CARs depend on both Pavlovian and instrumental learning; (ii) learning the Pavlovian component of CARs depends on the NAc-co; learning the instrumental component of CARs depends on the DLS, NAc and DMS; (iii) although the NAc-co is also needed for learning the instrumental component, it is not clear whether it plays a role in learning the instrumental component per se or if it simply allows learning of the Pavlovian component which is a pre-condition for learning the instrumental component; (iv) we did not find evidence that the DMS and DLS play the same roles in habit and goal-directed aspects of the instrumental component of CARs as observed in appetitive motivated instrumental responding.",H & L,483

It is therefore both important and feasible to establish new breakdown parameters for assessing the appropriateness of a fluid description at the continuum level by utilizing kinetic information rather than macroscopic flow quantities alone. We propose a new kinetic criterion to indirectly assess the errors introduced by a continuum-level description of the gas flow. The analysis, which includes numerical demonstrations, focuses on the validity of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations and corresponding kinetic models and reveals that the new criterion can consistently indicate the validity of continuum-level modeling in both low-speed and high-speed flows at different Knudsen numbers.",C,624

The results from TVA and TGA analyses show that the APP foam undergoes a significantly different degradation mechanism to the standard foam that we have reported on previously. The TGA results revealed the presence of a two-stage degradation process under a non-oxidative environment. The TVA results, on the other hand, revealed that degradation of the APP foam in fact occurs in four overlapping steps compared to the two-step process which occurs for the standard foam. The additional degradation steps observed for the APP foam are proposed to correspond to degradation of the fire retardant. Evolution of volatile material was also observed to occur at a lower temperature for the APP foam and it is proposed that the primary degradation of the urethane linkages via a depolycondensation reaction is acid-catalysed by the acidic hydroxyl groups which arise from degradation of APP. The sub-ambient differential distillation trace revealed that the nature and distribution of the volatiles evolved from the APP foam were profoundly different to the standard foam, which confirms that the secondary degradation is also altered in the presence of APP.",F & K,325

Two experimental case studies have been chosen to evaluate the IM-EDP (Sa-Sd, ISDmax%) estimates obtained from the three different capacity spectrum procedures, as well as from non-linear time-history analyses (NLTHA). It is found that all three approaches perform well in estimating the response of a simple steel frame, but that FRACAS provides the best estimate of the response of an irregular reinforced concrete frame.

A difference-in-differences approach is used to isolate a ""credit channel"" impact of the global financial crisis on foreign direct investment. The global financial crisis had a stronger negative impact on the relative volume of outward foreign direct investment in financially vulnerable sectors in more financially developed countries, especially if these countries also experienced a banking crisis.

C,A material-based platform to modulate fibronectin activity and focal adhesion assembly,https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-material-based-platform-to-modulate-fibronectin-activity-and-fo,"We present a detailed characterization of fibronectin (FN) adsorption and cell adhesion on poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) and poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA), two polymers with very similar physicochemical properties and chemical structure, which differ in one single methyl group in the lateral chain of the polymer. The globular solution conformation of FN was retained following adsorption onto PMA, whereas spontaneous organization of FN into protein (nano) networks occurred on PEA. This distinct distribution of FN at the material interface promoted a different availability, measured via monoclonal antibody binding, of two domains that facilitated integrin binding to FN: FNIII10 (RGD sequence) and FNIII9 (PHSRN synergy sequence). The enhanced exposure of the synergy domain on PEA compared to PMA triggered different focal adhesion assemblies: L929 fibroblasts showed a higher fraction of smaller focal plaques on PMA (40%) than on PEA (20%). Blocking experiments with monoclonal antibodies against FNIII10 (HFN7.1) and FNIII9 (mAb1937) confirmed the ability of these polymeric substrates to modulate FN conformation. Overall, we propose a simple and versatile material platform that can be used to tune the presentation of a main extracellular matrix protein (FN) to cells, for applications than span from tissue engineering to disease biology.",E & A,437
