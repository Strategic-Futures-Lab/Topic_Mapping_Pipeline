# Topic Model Modules

The Topic Model modules come third on the list of modules in the Topic Mapping pipeline. It uses the lemmas data 
[previously created](LemmatiseModule.md) to create one or more topic model(s) from it. The lemmas data is then saved in
a ***Document JSON file*** and topics are saved in ***Topic JSON file(s)***.

The Topic Model modules are contained in the `P3_TopicModelling` package.

## List of Topic Model Modules

There are two Topic Model modules:
- ***Topic Modelling*** (`TopicModelling.java` class), which samples a single model from the lemmas;
- ***Hierarchical Topic Modelling*** (`HierarchicalTopicModelling.java` class), which samples two separate topic models
(using the Topic Modelling module), a main model and a sub model, and creates an assignment between the two to create 
a two-layers hierarchical model.

## Specifications

The Topic Model module entry in the project file should has the following structure:
```json5
{...
  "model": {
    "lemmas": "path",
    "modelType": "module name",
    "outputDir" | "dataDir": "path",
    "documentOutput": "path",
    "mainModel": { ... },
    "subModel": { ... },
    "hierarchy": { ... }
  }
...}
```

- \* These paths are relative to the [data directory](MetaParameters.md);
- \** This gets overwritten by the [model type meta-parameter](MetaParameters.md) (if set);
- \*** This path is relative to the `outputDir` directory.

The specifiations for `mainModel` (or `model`) and `subModel` follow the same structure:
```json5
{...
  "model":{...
    "mainModel": {
      "topics": 10,
      "words": 20,

- \*** If set to `true`, the word distances between documents and topics will be saved in the `documentOutput` JSON file.

The specification for `hierarchy` should follow this structure:
```json5
{...
  "model":{...
    "hierarchy": {
      "assignmentType" :  "Perceptual",
      "maxAssign": 1,

- \* These paths are relative to the `outputDir` directory.

## Output

The Topic Model modules output multiple files.

First, the document JSON file, which follows a similar structure to the lemmas and corpus files:
```json5
{
  "metadata":{...
    "nTopicsMain":20,
    "nTopicsSub":30
  },
  "documents":[
    {
      "docId":"0",
      "docIndex":0,
      "numLemmas":107,
      "docData":{"key": "value", ...},
      "mainTopicDistribution":[ ... ],
      "subTopicDistribution":[ ... ],
      "mainTopicFullWordDistances":[ ... ],
      "subTopicFullWordDistances":[ ... ],
      "mainTopicCompWordDistances":[ ... ],
      "subTopicCompWordDistances":[ ... ]
    },{
      "docId": "1",
      "docIndex": 1,
      "removed": true,
      "removeReason":"Too short",
      "numLemmas": 2,
      "docData": {"key": "value2", ...}
    },...
  ]
}
```

In addition to the information from the lemmas file, the `metadata` now also contains:
- the number of topics `nTopicsMain`, if the simple Topic Modelling module was used;
- the number of main topics `nTopicsMain` and sub topics `nTopicsSub`, if the Hierarchical Topic Modelling module
was used.

Then the file has a `documents` list, with one object per document with the following information:
- `docId` the document id;
- `docIndex` the document index;
- `numLemmas` the number of lemmas in that document;
- `docData` the document data that was kept with `docFields`;
- if the document inherited the `removed` and `removeReason` attributes from the lemma file, those are kept;
- otherwise, the document has been used in the topic model(s) and now has topic weights data:
    - `mainTopicDistribution` the list of (main) topic weights (regardless of which module was uses);
    - `subTopicDistribution` the list of sub topic weights (if the Hierarchical Topic Modelling module was used);
    - if `wordDistances` was set to true:
      - `mainTopicFullWordDistances` the list of word distances between (main) topics and the full document;
      - `mainTopicCompWordDistances` the list of word distances between (main) topics and their related document's components;
      - `subTopicFullWordDistances` the list of word distances between sub topics and the full document (if the Hierarchical Topic Modelling module was used);
      - `subTopicCompWordDistances` the list of word distances between sub topics and their related document's components (if the Hierarchical Topic Modelling module was used).
    
Second, the topic JSON file(s), either one if using the simple Topic Modelling module, or two if using the 
Hierarchical Topic Modelling module. They roughly follow the same structure:
```json5
{
  "metadata": {...
    "nTopics": 20,
    "nDocs": 20,
    "nWords": 10
  },
  "topics": [
    {
      "topicId": "0",
      "topicIndex": 0,
      "topDocs": [{"docId": "id", "weight": 0.7778}, ... ],
      "topWords": [{"label": "risk", "weight": 85.0}, ... ],
      "subTopicIds": [ ... ],
      "mainTopicIds": [ ... ]
    }, ...
  ],
  "similarities": [ [ ... ], ... ]
}
```

In addition to the metadata from the lemmas JSON file, the following fields are added:
- the number of topics `nTopics`;
- the number of top documents per topic `nDocs`;
- the number of top words per topic `nWords`.

Then, the file has list of `topics`, with one object per topic with the following fields:
- `topicId` the topic id;
- `topicIndex` the topic index, used for example in the documents' topic distributions or in the `topicSimilarity`;
- `topDocs` the top documents for that topic, with their `docId` and `weight`;
- `topWords` the top words for that topic, with their `label` and `weight`;
- if the Hierarchical Topic Modelling module was used, an additional field is added:
    - `subTopicIds`, if this is the main topic JSON file, containing the list of sub topic ids assigned to that main
    topic;
    - `mainTopicIds`, if this the sub topic JSON file, containing the list of main topic ids assigend to that sub
    topic.
    
Finally, the topic JSON file has `similarities` which contains the similarity matrix between the topics in that file.
The matrix is in the form of a list of list of numbers:
```json5
{...
  "similarities": [
    [0-0, 0-1, 0-2, ..., 0-n],
    [1-0, 1-1, 1-2, ..., 1-n],
    [2-0, 2-1, 2-2, ..., 2-n],
    ...,
    [n-0, n-1, n-2, ..., n-n]
  ]
}
```
