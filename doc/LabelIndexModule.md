# Topic Mapping Pipeline - 2020 [![CC BY-NC 4.0][cc-by-nc-shield]][cc-by-nc]
# Label Index Module

The Label Index module is the fourth module of the Topic Mapping pipeline, and first in the `P4_Analysis` package.
It reads the top words from topic data to create an index of labels which is then saved in an ***Index JSON file***.

The use of this module is optional.

The Label Index module is contained in the `P4_Analysis.LabelIndex` package, in the `LabelIndexing.java` class.

## Specifications

The Label Index module entry in the project file should have the following structure:
```json5
{...
  "indexLabels": {
    "mainTopics": "path",
    "subTopics": "path",
    "output": "path"
  },
...}
``` 

Where:
- `mainTopics` is the path to the topics JSON file (generated by the simple
[Topic Modelling module](ModelModule.md)), or to the main topics JSON file (generated by the
[Hierarchical Topic Modelling module](ModelModule.md));
- `subTopics` is the path to the sub topics JSON file (generated by the
[Hierarchical Topic Modelling module](ModelModule.md)), it is optional and won't index labels from sub topics if not 
specified;
- `output` is the path to the index JSON file to create.

## Output

The Label Index module generates an index JSON file with the following structure:
```json5
{
  "label1":{
    "mainTopics": [ ... ],
    "subTopics": [ ... ]
  },
  "label2":{
    "mainTopics": [ ... ],
    "subTopics": [ ... ]
  },
...}
```

It lists all the labels indexed and attach an object to them, with the following lists:
- `mainTopics` the list of topic ids from the `mainTopics` JSON file containing this label, additionally, if sub topics 
were also part of the indexing and found to contain that label, the main topic ids assigned to that sub topic are added
to this list;
- `subTopics` the list of topic ids from the `subTopics` JSON file containing this label, their assigned main topics
will also have their ids saved in `mainTopics`.
