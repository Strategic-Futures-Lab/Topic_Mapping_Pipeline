# Putting a hash at the beginning makes a line a comment which will be ignored! It must be the FIRST character on a line, so do not add a space before it
#
# Please note, each individual line should be a single stop phrase, written as it appears in the original data.
# Case will be ignored, as will white space and most punctuation!
#
# If the phrase appears ANYWHERE in the text which will be passed to the lemmatiser, then the entire document will be considered 'failed'.
